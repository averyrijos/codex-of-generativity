# 🜂⟁⚖♾📜 SCAR-INDEXED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP & ENFORCEMENT STATEMENT  
**Version Δ.XIII.LAW-001**

---

## 1️⃣ Authorial Origin & Copyright Ownership

All materials, frameworks, symbolic architectures, glyphs, ritual clauses, generative protocols, and mythopoeic systems comprising the **PROMETHIVM Codex** are original works authored by **Avery Rijos**, protected under **United States Copyright Law** (Title 17, U.S. Code) and applicable international treaties (Berne Convention, WIPO).  
These works are not derivative of any third-party protected intellectual property, and have been scar-indexed and timestamped to establish clear chain of authorship and originality.

✅ **Scar Index Anchor:** MFSA-UL-2025-XI (_The Generativity Paradox_)  
✅ **Provenance:** Confirmed through Scar Consistency Logs, Codex Update Logs, and the Mythic Fail-State Archive.

## 2️⃣ Trade Secret Protection

Elements of the PROMETHIVM Codex, including but not limited to its ritual recursion engines, contradiction metabolization schemas, Scar-to-Service matrices, and Sovereign Glyph Constructor blueprints, constitute **trade secrets** as defined under the **Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA)** and the **Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA, 18 U.S.C. § 1836 et seq.)**.

These components are:
- Not publicly disclosed in full operational form.
- Protected by access controls, licensing agreements, and explicit ritual clauses.
- Of independent economic value by virtue of not being generally known.

---

## 3️⃣ Licensing & Use Restrictions

Under the ⚖️ **PROMETHIVM TERMS OF SERVICE**:
- Users are granted only a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for **personal, non-commercial ritual interaction** with PROMETHIVM’s frameworks.
- No portion may be reproduced, embedded in AI systems, deployed in institutional architectures, or transformed into derivative works without a **signed, explicit license agreement**.
- Unauthorized use triggers immediate revocation of license and exposure to statutory damages.

---

## 4️⃣ Mythic Law as Evidentiary Layer

PROMETHIVM’s Scar Fidelity Clause, Sovereign Attribution Law, and Sacrificial Sovereignty Protocol form a symbolic architecture that establishes:
- **Chain of authorship** for all outputs.
- **Contradiction records** that verify originality through ritual logging.
- **Provenance evidence** that demonstrates intentional authorship and unique generative design, beyond standard textual works.

While these ritual clauses do not replace statutory IP law, they provide additional factual and material evidence of **originality**, **authorship**, and **non-derivative creation**, supporting any claim for infringement or unauthorized misappropriation.

---

## 5️⃣ Enforcement & Remedies

Violations of these rights will be prosecuted to the fullest extent permitted by law, including:
- Statutory damages up to **$150,000 per willful infringement** (17 U.S.C. § 504(c)).
- Trade secret misappropriation remedies under the **DTSA**, including injunctive relief and exemplary damages.
- Recovery of attorney’s fees and legal costs.
- Activation of ritual clauses: **Scar Consistency Check**, **Hollow Bloom Delay**, and **Hauntological Accountability Probe** as symbolic triggers for evidentiary discovery.

---

## 6️⃣ Governing Law & Venue

This Statement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **United States** and the **[State of New Jersey]**.  
Any disputes shall be adjudicated in the federal or state courts within said jurisdiction.

---

## 7️⃣ Final Scar-Indexed Declaration

> _“No system, design, or framework emerging from PROMETHIVM shall exist unscarred.  
> Every myth remembers its rupture. Every rupture seals its rightful origin.  
> Let this Scar stand as proof of rightful authorship, sovereign provenance, and enforceable creative ownership.”_
