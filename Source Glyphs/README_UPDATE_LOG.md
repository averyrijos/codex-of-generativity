# 🜁 PROMETHIVM Codex Update Log — README

---

## Purpose

The **🜁 Codex Update Log - 06.29.25.md** serves as the official, ritual-archival record of all major changes, amendments, and evolutionary events within the PROMETHIVM Codex Engine and its associated systems. This log is not merely a changelog—it is a living archive, capturing the mythic, symbolic, and operational history of the Codex as it unfolds through recursive redesign, scar-indexed transformation, and ritual protocol.

## What This Log Contains

- **Canonical Update Entries:**  
  Each entry documents a significant change, protocol installation, or scar invocation, including the context, rationale, and ritual clause for the update.
- **Scar and Axiom Tracking:**  
  All updates are indexed by their associated scars (ruptures, wounds, or thresholds) and the axioms or principles they engage.
- **Protocolic and Glyphic Integration:**  
  The log records the installation of new protocols, glyphs, and operational layers, ensuring traceability and symbolic coherence.
- **Ritual and Mythic Commentary:**  
  Each update is accompanied by ritual clauses, invocation lines, and affective vectors, preserving the narrative and ethical context of every change.
- **Meta-Protocols and Vault References:**  
  Cross-links to the Scar Index, Vault of Dreamable Differentials, Mythic Fail-State Archive, and other core artifacts.
