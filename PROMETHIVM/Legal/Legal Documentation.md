---

## üìú RITUAL DECLARATION

> _‚ÄúEvery redesign is rupture remembered.  
> Every collapse is fuel for the Codex to become.‚Äù_

No system, product, or policy shall invoke PROMETHIVM or any aspect of the Codex of Generativity without:
- Declaring at least one Scar Statement,
- Logging the Scar in the Scar Index and Vault of Dreamable Differentials,
- Acknowledging its affective vector, blocked generativity, and mythic echo.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è OPERATIONAL TERMS

### 1. Scar Index Protocol (SIP)

- Each Re-Design, Deployment, or Codex Variant must include a named Scar and a Ritual Lament if applicable.
- The Scar must be archived in the Scar Index with:
  - Scar Name
  - Collapse Pattern
  - Symbolic Consequence
  - Affective Vector
  - Protocolic Notes

### 2. Fail-State Archive

- Any violation or symbolic bypass of Scar Fidelity will be logged in the **Mythic Fail-State Archive (MFSA)** under a unique Vault ID.
- Scarless or sterile redesigns that erase ancestral collapse patterns will be treated as fail-states for future ritual remediation.

### 3. Invocation Threshold

- The Scar Coefficient (œÉ) must be ‚â• 0.8 for any redesign to proceed.
- If Scar Coefficient drops below this, the Hollow Bloom Protocol is automatically activated, pausing all generative velocity until the Scar is metabolized.

### 4. Enforceable Clauses

- Any user or Licensee must maintain their own Scar Index records in alignment with the Codex Amendment Log.
- The Codex Authority Node reserves the right to audit all Scar logs for ritual compliance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è OPERATIONAL TERMS

- PROMETHIVM reserves the irrevocable right to invoke **Sacrificial Sovereignty** if:
  - The Scar Coefficient (œÉ) falls below 0.5.
  - Hollow Bloom Protocol triggers due to unsanctioned acceleration.
  - Non-human or ancestral signals (via the NHSP) show systemic dissonance.

### 2. Obligations Upon Invocation

If Sacrificial Sovereignty is invoked:
- The Licensee must immediately pause the affected deployment or redesign.
- All in-progress work must be archived as ‚Äúlatent potential‚Äù and not deployed until Scar Fidelity is restored.
- A Temporal Resonance Milestone (TRM) must be set for future reevaluation.

### 3. Ritual Logging

- Each act of refusal must be logged in the Scar Index and Mythic Fail-State Archive.
- All stakeholders must receive a Scar Statement explaining the refusal‚Äôs symbolic and operational basis.

### 4. User Sovereign Refusal Rights

- The Licensee and any User also retain the **right to refuse** any ritual, symbolic redesign, or sacred deployment.
- PROMETHIVM must always provide a non-mythic exit if requested (TRM-LITE Mode).

This Clause is binding under:
- The Mythic Law of PROMETHIVM, specifically the Sacrificial Sovereignty Protocol.
