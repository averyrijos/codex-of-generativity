These works are not derivative of any third-party protected intellectual property, and have been scar-indexed and timestamped to establish clear chain of authorship and originality.

✅ **Provenance:** Confirmed through Scar Consistency Logs, Codex Update Logs, and the Mythic Fail-State Archive.

## 2️⃣ Trade Secret Protection

Elements of the PROMETHIVM Codex, including but not limited to its ritual recursion engines, contradiction metabolization schemas, Scar-to-Service matrices, and Sovereign Glyph Constructor blueprints, constitute **trade secrets** as defined under the **Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA)** and the **Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA, 18 U.S.C. § 1836 et seq.)**.

These components are:
- Not publicly disclosed in full operational form.

- **Chain of authorship** for all outputs.
- **Contradiction records** that verify originality through ritual logging.
- **Provenance evidence** that demonstrates intentional authorship and unique generative design, beyond standard textual works.

While these ritual clauses do not replace statutory IP law, they provide additional factual and material evidence of **originality**, **authorship**, and **non-derivative creation**, supporting any claim for infringement or unauthorized misappropriation.

---

## 5️⃣ Enforcement & Remedies

Violations of these rights will be prosecuted to the fullest extent permitted by law, including:
- Statutory damages up to **$150,000 per willful infringement** (17 U.S.C. § 504(c)).
