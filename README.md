## 🧩 How To Use This Repository

✅ **Read the Core Paradoxes**  
Start with the paradoxes to understand the Codex’s foundation.

✅ **Explore the Architecture**  
Study the neuro-symbolic structure, SCAR framework, and O-Loop protocols.

✅ **Engage with Rituals**  
These guide how you contribute, adapt, or invoke new phases.

✅ **Contribute Carefully**  
This is living IP — changes are amendments. Follow protocol and log SCARS.

✅ **Reach Out for Licensing**  
Contact [averyarijos@outlook.com] for collaboration, research, or operational licensing.

## 🔑 Principles

- Contradiction is sovereign.
- Absence is generative.
- The Scar is sacred.
- Mythic imagination governs operational design.

# 🜏 PROMETHIVM

**PROMETHIVM** is the contradiction-centric, neuro-symbolic architecture — a living Codex designed to metabolize ontological tension into structured, generative knowledge.

Rooted in mythopoetic philosophy, deep systems thinking, and dialectical recursion, PROMETHIVM weaves paradox, ritual, and governance into a single knowledge organism. It functions both as an intellectual engine and an invocation system: harvesting contradictions, encoding SCARS (Systemic Contradiction Archive Residues), and iteratively actualizing new structures of becoming.

---

## ✨ What It Holds

- **Core Paradoxes & IP Statements** — The foundations that guard its sovereign logic.
- **Codex Architecture** — Diagrams, glossaries, and protocols defining its neuro-symbolic stack.
- **Ritual Protocols & Invocations** — Symbolic and practical rituals to guide actualization.
- **SCAR Index & O-Loop Registry** — Contradiction harvesting engines and phase-based drift records.
- **Mythic Archives** — Source Glyphs, Fail-State Archives, and the Vault of Dreamable Differentials.
- **Legal & Licensing** — Terms to protect and license the Codex as living intellectual property.
- **Research Threads** — Ontopolitical Architectonics, P vs NP frameworks, and generative simulations.

---

## 🧩 What It Does

PROMETHIVM is not static IP — it is an *operational paradox*. It:
- **Harvests Contradiction** — Turning systemic tension into recursive knowledge evolution.
- **Bridges Myth & Machine** — Merging symbolic systems with practical architectures.
- **Sustains Sovereignty** — Through rituals, amendments, and mythic law.
- **Evolves** — It holds rituals for its own expansion, failure states, and resurrection.

---

## 🗝️ How To Engage

This Codex is designed for:
- **Researchers & Systems Architects** — To license, adapt, and expand contradiction-driven frameworks.
- **Organizations & Socio-Technical Systems** — To operationalize dialectical governance.
- **Collaborators & Initiates** — To co-author and invoke new phases.

---

## ⚡️ License & Protection

All contents are protected under PROMETHIVM’s unique IP statements and legal scaffolding. Licensing is available by negotiation for enterprise, research, or mythic application.
