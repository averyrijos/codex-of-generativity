# Business Analysis Domains

This chapter addresses the practice of business analysis in more depth by investigating the five domains of business analysis and the tasks associated with gathering and developing requirements. 

This chapter explores solution design, traceability and monitoring, and solution evaluation.

The five domains of business analysis practice were originally defined as part of a conceptual framework identified through a role delineation study completed for PMI:

- Domain 1: Needs Assessment
- Domain 2: Business Analysis Planning
- Domain 3: Requirements Elicitation and Analysis
- Domain 4: Traceability and Monitoring
- Domain 5: Solution Evaluation

## 1. Needs Assessment

A **Needs Assessment** is a systematic process that involves identifying and evaluating the needs of an organization or group. This is done in order to understand what is necessary for the system or organization to function optimally. The information gathered is then used to develop a plan or set of recommendations for addressing those needs.

- What project solution addresses the problem or opportunity?
- Is the proposed solution a good use of organizational resources?
- What business value will be realized?

Performing a **Needs Assessment** is crucial for several reasons. It helps to identify gaps in resources, pinpoint areas for improvement, and align solutions with strategic goals. By understanding the organization's current state and desired future state, it is possible to develop an effective and efficient action plan to bridge the gap. Moreover, it ensures that the implemented solution provides the maximum possible value to the organization, justifying the use of resources.

### **Needs Assessment Process**

- **Identify Problem or Opportunity**: Communicate with stakeholders and identify the problem or the opportunity.
    - When no internal data exists or when it cannot be feasibly collected, benchmarking may be performed. **Benchmarking** is a process used in management that involves comparing the business processes and performance metrics of an organization to those of the best practices from other companies in the industry.
        - It allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-time event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.
    - **Situation Statement**: Define the problem or opportunity in clear, concise terms, taking into account the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders. This statement should clarify the issue at hand and its impact on the organization, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.
        - When the problem is understood, the business analyst should draft a situation statement by documenting the current problem that needs to be solved or the opportunity to be explored. The format of the situation statement is as follows:
            - Problem (or opportunity) of A
            - Has the effect of B
            - With the impact of C
- **Assess Current State**: Examine the current environment to understand the cause or reason for a problem or an opportunity.
    - Goals and objectives that are relevant to the situation provide the context and direction for any change or solution that addresses the business need. The situation statement is therefore a key input in assessing the current state and proposing changes as a future state:
        - **Current State:** Examine the current environment to understand important factors that are internal or external to the organization and that may be the cause of reason for a problem or an opportunity.
        - **Future State:** Determine gaps in existing capabilities and propose changes that address the problem or opportunity.
    - Professionals use various data collection techniques to assess states:
        - **Document analysis**: An elicitation technique used to analyze existing documentation and identify relevant product information, such as training materials, product literature, standard operating procedures, or deliverables from past projects
        - **Interviews**: A formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders
        - **Observation**: An elicitation technique that provides a direct way of eliciting information about how a process is performed or how a product is used that involves viewing individuals in their own environment performing a task
        - **Questionnaires and surveys**: Written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents
    - Various tools can be used to assess states and to perform root cause analysis, which is the process of breaking down a situation into its root causes or opportunity contributors in order to adequately recommend a viable and appropriate solution.
        - **Pareto diagram**: Also known as the rule of 80/20, a Pareto diagram communicates the results of a root cause analysis.
        - **Process flow**: This type of diagram describes business processes and the ways stakeholders interact with those processes.
        - **Value stream map**: This tool, which is similar to a process flow, can be used to identify process steps that add value (value stream) and those that do not add value (waste).
        - **Root cause analysis**: Various techniques can be used to determine the basic underlying reason for a variance, defect, or risk.
        - **Cause-and-effect, Ishikawa, or fishbone diagram**: This type of diagram can be used to depict a problem and its root causes in a visual manner. A cause-and-effect diagram decomposes a problem or an opportunity and helps trace an event back to its root cause. Such a diagram helps to break down a business problem or opportunity into components to aid understanding. Most problems have multiple reasons, and Ishikawa diagrams provide a helpful way to look at the different contributing factors.
        - **Five whys**: With this technique, someone who is trying to understand a problem asks why it is occurring up to five times in order to thoroughly understand the problem’s causes.
        - **SWOT analysis**: SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. SWOT analysis is a technique that facilitates discussions with stakeholders when formulating a strategic conversation in reaction to changes in the marketplace in an organization.
- **Determine Future State**: Determine gaps and propose changes necessary to attain a desired future state that addresses the problem or opportunity under analysis.
    - Various other tools are popular for defining and describing future states:
        - **Affinity diagram**: An affinity diagram is a graphical figure that shows categories and subcategories of ideas that cluster or have an affinity to one another.
        - **Feature model**: A feature model provides a visual representation of all the features of a solution, arranged in a tree or hierarchical structure.
        - **Gap analysis**: Gap analysis is a technique for comparing two entities, usually the as-is and to-be states of a business.
        - **Kano analysis**: This technique is used to model and analyze product features by considering the features from the viewpoint of the customer.
        - **Process flow**: A process flow is also used as a tool to depict the business process in the current state and model changes in the process that would be seen in future options that could be pursued.
        - **Alignment model**: An alignment model helps a product team link business strategy to product strategy.
        - **Solution capability matrix**: This model provides a simple visual way to examine capabilities and solution components in one view and identifies capabilities to address in the new solution.
- **Determine Viable Options and Recommend Solution**: Apply various analytic techniques to examine possible solutions for meeting the business goals and objectives and to determine the best potential solution.
    - **Benchmarking**: This process involves comparing an organization’s practices, processes, and measurements of results against established standards or “best in class” organizations within the industry.
    - **Cost–benefit analysis**: This financial analysis tool is used to compare the benefits of a portfolio component, program, or project against its costs.
    - **Elicitation techniques**: Various techniques are used to draw information from different sources.
    - **Feature injection**: This process focuses discussions and analysis on introducing features where there can be an immediate return of value. Feature injection is popular with adaptive development methods.
    - **Real options**: This thought process approaches decision making with the same level of thinking used with a stock option, where a decision is made about whether to pursue an option and at what point. Real options is a decision-making thought process suited for an adaptive delivery approach.
    - **Valuation techniques**: Various techniques are used to quantify the return or value that an option will provide. Some of the most common valuation techniques include the following:
        - **Internal rate of return (IRR)**: An investment’s projected annual yield incorporates initial and ongoing costs. The value signifies the interest rate at which the net present value of all the cash flows will equal zero. IRR is a measure of return to cost; therefore, the higher the IRR is, the higher the return from a solution will be.
        - **Net present value (NPV)**: NPV provides insight into whether an investment will provide value; the higher the NPV is, the greater the value an option is expected to provide.
        - **Payback period (PBP)**: PBP is the time needed to recover an investment; the longer the PBP is, the greater the risk will be.
        - **Return on investment (ROI)**: ROI is the percentage return on an initial investment. ROI is calculated by dividing the total projected net benefits by the cost of the investment.
- **Facilitate Product Roadmap Development:** Support the development of a product roadmap at a high level and a potential sequence for delivery.
    - **Feature model**: This scoping model visually represents all the features of a solution arranged in a tree or hierarchical structure. A facilitated workshop can be conducted to identify the features and prioritize the feature list into a product roadmap.
    - **Product visioning**: This technique is used to set the high-level direction for a product or a product release. It entails conducting conversations with team members to visualize and obtain agreement about what the team envisions for the product.
    - **Story mapping**: This technique is used to sequence user stories, based upon their business value and the order in which users typically perform them, so that teams can arrive at a shared understanding of what will be built. Stories are written at a high level and may exist as epics. Epics are later decomposed into other epics or individual stories.
    - A **product roadmap** is a strategic document that outlines the vision, direction, and progress of a product over time. It outlines the goals of the product, the features to be developed to achieve these goals, and the timeline for the implementation of these features. It serves as a guiding document for the product team and helps communicate the product strategy to stakeholders.
- **Assemble Business Case**: Synthesize a well-researched business case that addresses the business goals and objectives.
    - **Problem/opportunity**: What is prompting the need for action. You can use a situation statement to document the business problem or opportunity to be addressed through a portfolio component, program, or project, and you can include relevant data to assess the situation and identify which stakeholders are affected.
    - **Analysis of the situation**: How a potential solution supports and contributes to the business goals and objectives. You can include the root cause(s) of the problem or the main contributors to an opportunity. You can support the analysis through relevant data to confirm the rationale.
    - **Recommendation**: The results of the feasibility analysis for each potential option. You can specify any constraints, assumptions, risks, and dependencies for each option. You can rank the alternatives and list the recommended solution with an explanation.
    - **Cost–benefit analysis**: The costs and benefits related to the recommended option.
    - **Evaluation**: A plan for measuring benefits realization. This plan typically includes metrics for evaluating how the solution contributes to goals and objectives.
- **Support Charter Development:** Collaborate on charter development with the sponsors.

## **2. Business Analysis Planning**

The Business Analysis Planning Domain deals with activities that help identify the best approach to organizing the upcoming tasks requirements elicitation, analysis, and solution evaluation. 

For the Business Analysis Planning Domain, a business analyst needs to determine the best approach and method to perform the upcoming business analysis activities. The outcome of the business analysis planning process is documented in a business analysis plan.

Key activities that need to be addressed ahead of time in order to produce this business analysis plan follow:

- **Identifying Stakeholders**: Identify the beneficiaries of the project that can impact success.
- **Understanding and Engaging Stakeholders**: Group stakeholders by their needs and determine the best way to elicit information from them.
- **Requirements Management**: Identify processes for validating, verifying, and approving requirements and solutions. Communicate and define procedures for managing changes to requirements.
- **Evaluation**: Determine a plan for requirements traceability and validating the solution.
- **Project Approach**: Choose the project approach (predictive, adaptive, or hybrid). Business analysis planning is based on the project approach and life cycle. With an adaptive approach, there is generally no need to create an exhaustive business analysis plan up front because there is an opportunity to conduct business analysis planning several times during the project increments.

> *Note - A **business analysis plan** describes how the requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, and managed across the project. A **requirements management plan** covers planning decisions for both the product and project requirements. The business analysis plan works together with the requirements management plan; therefore, the business analyst should work together with the project manager to ensure that all types of requirements are properly defined.*
> 

The business analysis plan will be leveraged properly only if stakeholders realize that the business analyst role is supportive and that the work plan will be of value to the team members, regardless of the project methodology that the project manager selects.

## 3. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis

One of the most important competencies required for being a successful business analyst is eliciting and analyzing **requirements** from stakeholders. 

Much overlap exists between traditional project management scope management and the Requirements Elicitation and Analysis Domain. Without a formal business analysis role, a project team member is engaged in the same tasks of elicitation and analysis using the same tools and techniques introduced in this section. 

Two distinct components are associated with this domain: **eliciting requirements from stakeholders** and **analyzing the information gathered**. 

The goal is to document requirements and model data to develop a solution that meets the requirements of the business. Because these two tasks are tightly coupled and enhanced progressively, we can refer to this entire domain as the analysis domain.

- **Functional Requirements** refer to the specific functionalities that a system or product should possess. They describe what the product will do by specifying behaviors or operations. For instance, in a banking software system, a functional requirement would be the ability for a customer to transfer money from one account to another.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**, on the other hand, describe how a system or product should be. They define the system properties and constraints such as system performance, reliability, and security. Using the same banking software system example, a non-functional requirement might be that the system must handle 10,000 simultaneous users or that it must protect sensitive customer data.

**Requirements elicitation** is a crucial part of the business analysis process. It involves communicating with stakeholders to gather, capture, and understand their needs and requirements for a particular system or product. This process can involve various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, or document analysis. The goal is to gather detailed, clear, and concise requirements that align with the business objectives. These requirements are then analyzed, documented, and used as the foundation for the development of the solution.

At this stage, a business analyst executes this task by doing the following:

- Asking well-thought-out questions of stakeholders
- Assisting stakeholders in formulating requirements
- Using appropriate techniques to elicit information
- Not focusing on “how” in the elicitation step

When talking about requirements, the term **elicit** is preferred over the term gather for various reasons. The terminology collecting or gathering requirements implies that stakeholders already have requirements ready to be collected or gathered, but that is often not the case. **Part of a business analyst’s job is to help stakeholders define the problem or opportunity and determine what should be done to address the needs of a solution.**

![Untitled](Untitled%2025.png)

Elicitation techniques:

- **Brainstorming**: This technique is used when you want to explore as many ideas as possible. It encourages free and open discussion, allowing team members to suggest ideas off the top of their head. It's a great way to encourage creative thinking and generate a large number of ideas.
- **Document Analysis**: Document analysis involves reviewing the existing documentation of a system or process to gather details about system requirements. These documents could be technical specifications, reports, manuals, etc. This method is useful when the aim is to gain an understanding of the details of an existing system.
- **Requirements Workshops**: These are structured meetings in which stakeholders collaborate to define and refine system requirements. They are facilitated by a trained moderator and are useful for gathering information quickly, resolving conflicts, and building consensus among a group of stakeholders.
- **Focus Groups**: These are structured discussions used to obtain detailed information about a specific issue from a targeted group of individuals. They are typically facilitated by a trained moderator and are useful for obtaining diverse opinions and attitudes about a specific topic.
- **Interviews**: This is a one-on-one technique used to gather information from stakeholders. It allows for an in-depth understanding of a stakeholder's views, experiences, and beliefs regarding a system or process.
- **Observation**: This technique involves watching users as they work in their natural environment. It is a good way to understand the existing system, business processes, and user requirements. It can be done either passively (watching users perform tasks) or actively (participating in the tasks).
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: These are a series of written questions used to gather information from a large number of people. They are useful for gathering statistical data and can reach a large audience quickly and inexpensively.
- **Prototyping**: This technique involves creating a working model of the proposed system to help stakeholders understand how it will function. It can be particularly useful when the stakeholder's requirements are not clear, or when there is a need to validate requirements.
    - **High-fidelity prototypes** are detailed and interactive models of a product that closely resemble the final product. They are often used in the later stages of the design process when it is important to test the product with users in a realistic context.
    - On the other hand, **low-fidelity prototypes** are simple and often non-interactive representations of a product. They are typically used in the early stages of the design process to quickly explore and iterate on design ideas. Examples of low-fidelity prototypes include paper sketches or wireframes.

![Untitled](Untitled%2026.png)

When you have completed the elicitation of the requirements and you have created some preliminary output documents (notes, flowcharts, or process sketches), the next step is to analyze and model the preliminary elicitation results you uncovered. This activity is referred to as **requirements analysis.** 

**Requirements analysis** has three objectives:

- To ensure that stakeholders understand the requirements just recognized by them
- To present the requirements in sufficient detail that the technical team can implement the planned solution
- To ensure that the business stakeholders see the value of the product increments clearly so that they can prioritize the releases

### Key Processes of Requirements Analysis

**Determine Analysis Approach**: Determine what will be analyzed, which models will be beneficial to produce, and how requirements will be verified, validated, and prioritized.

**Create and Analyze Models**: Create structured representations, such as diagrams, tables, or structured text, of any product information to facilitate further analysis.

**Define and Elaborate Requirements**: Refine and document requirements and other types of product information at the appropriate level of detail, format, and formality required for the life cycle.

**Define Acceptance Criteria**: Obtain agreement about what constitutes proof that one or more aspects of a solution have been developed successfully.

**Verify Requirements**: Ensure that requirements are of sufficient quality.

**Validate Requirements**: Ensure that the requirements meet business goals and objectives.

**Prioritize Requirements and Other Product Information**: Understand how individual pieces of product information achieve stakeholder objectives and use that information to facilitate the ranking of the work.

---

The best way to communicate a requirement is to model information in an organized manner that provides clarity to stakeholders. A business analyst is responsible for developing the solution, and the model is a good tool to define and validate a solution.

A good model helps address correctness and completeness as well. A business analysis model could be a diagram, a table, or a description of a process or service using structured text. The abstract representation helps clarify the requirements and the proposed solution. Different types of models can be used.

- **Scope Models**: These models help define the boundaries of a project, providing a clear understanding of what is included or excluded from the project. They typically outline the project's functional areas, stakeholder roles, system interfaces, and data elements.
    - **Example**: A context diagram that shows the system under development and its interactions with external entities like users, external systems, and data sources.
- **Process Models**: These models map out the activities involved in a business process, showing how tasks are related and highlighting dependencies. They usually include workflows, decision points, roles, and data flows. Examples include flowcharts and swimlane diagrams.
    - **Example**: A swimlane diagram that delineates the process of order fulfillment, showing the roles of customer service, warehouse, and shipping departments along with their respective tasks and decision points.
- **Rule Models**: These models define the business rules that guide the operation of a business process or system. They detail the conditions and actions that dictate the decision-making within a system. Examples include decision tables and decision trees.
    - **Example**: A decision table that outlines the rules for approving or rejecting loan applications based on criteria like credit score, income level, and loan amount.
- **Data Models**: These models illustrate how data is structured, organized, and interconnected within a system. They provide a clear picture of the data elements, their relationships, and constraints. Examples include entity-relationship diagrams and class diagrams.
    - **Example**: An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that shows the relationships between customer, order, and product entities in an e-commerce database.
- **Interface Models**: These models represent the interaction points between different systems or between users and a system. They outline the input and output elements and describe how data is exchanged. They can also include mock-ups or wireframes of user interfaces.
    - **Example**: A wireframe that details the layout and elements of an online shopping cart page, showing how users interact with the system to add, remove, or update items.

---

Models that structure and organize the features, functions, and boundaries of the business domain being analyzed can be grouped as **scope models,** which help with the definition of project scope. These common elements are used to create such scope models:

**Scope statement -** this document specifies the requirements in detail and describes what features are in scope or out of scope. 

**Ecosystem map -** shows the applicable systems, their relationships, and the data passed between them.

**Context diagram -** this is a representation of a system and human interaction within a solution. It portrays the in-scope systems and any inputs or outputs and actors interacting with the system. 

- A **feature model,** also known as a feature mind map, is a *scope model t*hat visually represents all the features of a solution in a tree or hierarchical structure. Such models are used in the initial stages of a project. Feature models are helpful for showing how features are grouped together, and which features are subfeatures of other ones.
- A **use case diagram** is a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that defines how a system interacts with its environment by illustrating the activities that are performed by the users of the system (also known as actors) and the system's responses. It provides a high-level view of the functional capabilities of the system, represented as a set of use cases, and the relationships between the actors and the use cases.

![Untitled](Untitled%2027.png)

---

**Process Models** are diagrams or flowcharts that map out the sequence of activities involved in a business process. They show how tasks are interconnected, highlight dependencies and decision points, and illustrate the flow of data. Process Models are instrumental in understanding the current process and designing an improved one. Examples of Process Models include flowcharts and swimlane diagrams (process flows).

- **Process Flow**: A process flow is a diagram that visually represents the sequence of tasks and decisions involved in a business process. It is used to understand the current process, identify potential improvements, and illustrate how tasks are interconnected. Process flows often include decision points, roles, and data flows.
- **Use Case Diagrams Depicting Process Flow**: Use Case Diagrams are a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that showcase the interactions between a system and its environment. They illustrate the activities performed by the system's users, or actors, and the system's responses. Use Case Diagrams provide a high-level overview of a system's functional capabilities and the relationships between actors and use cases, and can be used to depict process flow.
- **User Stories**: A User Story is a simple, concise description of a software feature from the perspective of an end user. Written in everyday language, user stories detail what the user wants to achieve, often formatted as: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit or outcome]". User stories help teams understand the user's needs and why a particular feature is valuable.
    - The **INVEST** acronym can be applied to ensure that a user story is useful and ready for construction by the development team:
        - **Independent**: Each story should stand alone, and dependencies should not be created between stories.
        - **Negotiable**: In the spirit of the adaptive approach, a story is subject to negotiation at all times, regarding the content, function, or priority.
        - **Valuable**: A story defines only features or functions that are valuable.
        - **Estimable**: A story should be clear enough to generate a valid estimate.
        - **Small**: A story should be small enough to be implemented. If it isn’t, it should be decomposed to fit within an iteration.
        - **Testable**: Each story should be independently verifiable.

## 4. Traceability and Monitoring

This domain has five key tasks:

- Trace requirements
- Monitor requirements
- Update requirements
- Communicate requirements status
- Manage changes to requirements

During **traceability and monitoring,** the traceability matrix and associated attributes are assigned and applied to help monitor and control the product scope. Approved requirements for a specific phase are baselined and tracked. 

- If new requirements surface, they are assessed in terms of their impact to the project and product and are presented to stakeholders for approval. All new requirements need to be documented and added to the traceability matrix for monitoring.

**Traceability** is the ability to track product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. Traceability is considered a bidirectional activity because requirements can be traced forward to the solution being developed and backward to the business requirements. Any requirements that are not traced to the business objectives can be considered **out of scope.** 

Approved requirements all need to be baselined in a document called the **traceability matrix** so that you know how to verify them as having been completed correctly. As new requirements appear, you need to add them to the traceability matrix.

Changes to requirements need to be managed. The project manager needs to assess the impact of any new or changed requirements on the project and present them to stakeholders for approval.

### Manage Changes to Requirements

**Impact analysis** is a process of identifying the potential consequences of a change in a business system or process. It involves evaluating the effect of the change on all other aspects of the system, including processes, workflows, and stakeholders. The purpose of impact analysis is to help decision-makers understand the implications of the change, allowing them to plan for and manage potential impacts effectively.

## 5. Solution Evaluation

**Evaluation** is the systematic assessment of the design, implementation, and outcomes of a project or process to determine its effectiveness, efficiency, and overall impact. It involves collecting and analyzing data to make informed decisions, improve performance, and ensure that objectives are being met.

The Solution Evaluation Domain processes are as follows:

**Evaluate Solution Performance:** Thoroughly evaluate a solution to determine whether the implemented solution or solution component is delivering the intended business value. This can be regarded as a comprehensive solution validation process that involves collecting data, analyzing performance metrics, and comparing the outcomes with the initial objectives. Additionally, it is important to conduct regular reviews and updates to ensure that the solution remains aligned with evolving business needs and objectives. This phase may include the use of various performance measurement tools and techniques, such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), balanced scorecards, and benchmarking against industry standards.

**Determine Solution Evaluation Approach:** Carefully determine which specific aspects of the organization or solution will be evaluated. This involves deciding how performance will be measured, identifying appropriate performance indicators, and specifying the time frames for these measurements. Additionally, assign roles to individuals who will be responsible for conducting these evaluations and ensure they have the necessary resources and tools. It is also essential to develop a structured evaluation plan that includes detailed methodologies and protocols for consistent and accurate assessments. This plan can include both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, and statistical analysis.

**Evaluate Acceptance Results and Address Defects:** Systematically identify and resolve any problems or defects with the product. This involves a detailed review process where the results from a comparison of the defined acceptance criteria against the solution are carefully analyzed. Based on these results, decisions are made on the necessary corrective actions or improvements to meet the acceptance standards. Moreover, it is crucial to establish a feedback loop where identified defects are documented, and the solutions are rigorously tested to prevent recurrence. This could involve creating defect logs, conducting root cause analysis, and implementing corrective and preventive actions.

**Obtain Solution Acceptance for Release:** Facilitate a well-informed decision-making process on whether to release a partial or full solution into production. This phase includes ensuring that all stakeholders are in agreement and that the transition of knowledge about the product, such as risks, known issues, and workarounds, is effectively managed. This phase deals with obtaining the final solution sign-off and ensuring readiness for deployment. Furthermore, it encompasses comprehensive training sessions for end users and support teams to ensure a smooth transition and minimal disruption during the release phase. This may also involve developing detailed release notes, user manuals, and conducting mock go-live sessions.

**Evaluate Deployed Solution:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the product after its implementation to gauge how successful the project was. This involves collecting feedback from end users or the operations business personnel who have interacted with the solution. The evaluation should consider the overall user experience, any encountered issues, and the extent to which the solution meets the intended business objectives and improves operational efficiency. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and periodic re-evaluations should be conducted to ensure the solution continues to deliver value over time and adapts to any new business requirements or changes in the operating environment. This could involve setting up a continuous improvement process, conducting post-implementation reviews, and establishing a system for capturing and analyzing user feedback.

# Business Analysis Frameworks

## High-Level Business Analysis

A fundamental difference exists between the practice of business analysis and the practice of project management.

The focus of **business analysis** is to analyze business problems, recommend a solution, elicit requirements from stakeholders who contribute to the requirements, and document the requirements.

The focus of **project management** is the management of projects *that implement solutions.*

- A project manager ensures that resources are procured and applied and makes sure that a product, service, or program is successfully delivered to the business.

Conceptually and logically, therefore, Business Analysis precedes Project Management. The disciplines of business analysis and project management work in synchronization to facilitate the success of a proposed solution, which is typically a product, service or program. 

The focus of PMI’s integration of business analysis with project management is primarily on business analysis work done in the context of a project. Therefore, this book and the CAPM® exam both address business analysis topics concerning stakeholder needs, scope, requirements, and project-oriented solutions.

**Business Analysis** is a set of activities performed to determine business needs and identify solutions. Business analysis is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to elicit, document, and manage requirements. 

![Untitled](Untitled%2023.png)

A list of functions associated with business analysis can include these:

- Strategic business analysis
- Comprehensive enterprise analysis
- Feasibility studies and definition of new business opportunities
- Scoping of an opportunity and identification of a preliminary solution
- Preparation of a business case for a solution

In the early stages of a project, a business analyst plays a key role in determining business requirements, tailoring the project methodology for business analysis activities, selecting appropriate tools and techniques to elicit requirements from stakeholders, analyzing needs, and documenting needs as specifications or user stories. Subsequently, a business analyst develops functional and nonfunctional requirements and defines a solution for the development team

## Requirements: The Focus of Business Analysis

**Requirement -** a condition or capability that must be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a business need. 

- A requirement represents something that should describe a product or service and address a need of a business, a person, or a group of people.

Requirements can be very high level, such as those found in a business case or a business goal. Alternatively, they can be very detailed, such as those found in the acceptance criteria for a system component. A requirement should be independent of the design of the solution that addresses it. A correctly defined requirement is **unambiguous**, **complete**, **necessary**, **feasible**, and **verifiable**

- In the field, you will find many terms used to refer to requirements, including capability, feature, function, model, user story, and use case.
- **Business Requirements**: High-level statements of the goals, objectives, or needs of the organization. They describe what the organization hopes to achieve with the solution.
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: Statements of the needs of a particular stakeholder or stakeholder group. They may serve as a bridge between business requirements and solution requirements.
- **Solution Requirements**: Describe the features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. They are further divided into:
    - **Functional Requirements**: Specify what the system should do, describing the specific behaviors or functions of the system.
    - **Nonfunctional Requirements**: Define how the system should behave, outlining the qualities and attributes of the system such as performance, usability, reliability, et cetera. They describe the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective.
- **Transition Requirements**: Define any conditions or capabilities that must be met to transition from the current state to the future state. They are temporary and only applicable until the transition is complete.
- **Project Requirements**: Outline the actions, processes, or conditions needed to complete the project. They are not specific to the product, service, or result but are necessary to manage the project effectively.
- **Quality Requirements**: Define the criteria that will be used to judge the quality of the product, service, or result. They ensure that the deliverables meet the necessary standards and expectations.

It is important to keep a record of product requirements and other product information, along with whatever is recorded to manage it. In large projects, requirements are managed by having separate **requirements documentation** created for each type of requirement. These requirements may also exist in one document, separated by dedicated document sections.

**Requirements Documentation** - A comprehensive record that captures all the requirements for a project. It includes detailed descriptions of business, stakeholder, solution, transition, project, and quality requirements. This documentation ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what is needed to achieve the project's objectives. It serves as a reference throughout the project lifecycle, helping to manage and track changes, validate deliverables, and ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements.

**Requirements Management Plan** - A document that outlines how requirements will be identified, documented, analyzed, tracked, and managed throughout the project lifecycle. This plan ensures that all requirements are consistently and systematically handled, providing a framework for managing changes and maintaining traceability. It typically includes the following components:

- **Requirements Gathering and Documentation**: Processes and techniques to elicit and document requirements from stakeholders.
- **Requirements Prioritization**: Methods to prioritize requirements based on factors such as business value, risk, and dependencies.
- **Requirements Traceability**: Mechanisms to trace requirements throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that each requirement is addressed and fulfilled.
- **Change Management Procedure**: Steps to handle changes to requirements, including impact analysis, approval processes, and updating documentation.
- **Verification and Validation**: Approaches to ensure that requirements are met through testing, reviews, and stakeholder validation.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Definition of roles and responsibilities for managing requirements, including the involvement of stakeholders, business analysts, and project managers.
- **Tools and Techniques**: Tools and techniques that will be used to manage requirements, such as requirements management software, traceability matrices, and modeling techniques.

Having a well-defined **Requirements Management Plan** helps in aligning the project team and stakeholders, ensures clarity and transparency, and contributes to the successful delivery of the project.

# Stakeholders and the Business Analyst

The key processes involved in **business analysis** and **needs assessment** are as follows:

- **Stakeholder identificatio**n: Identify the individuals and groups that will participate in the activities of business analysis.
- **Stakeholder analysis**: Conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the individuals or groups.
- **Stakeholder engagement and communication approach**: Develop appropriate methods to engage and communicate with stakeholders.
- **Business analysis planning**: Understand the scope of business analysis work, roles, responsibilities, and skill sets for the tasks required to successfully start and complete the work.
- **Transitioning to a future state**: Measure readiness, move the organization from the current state to the future state, and integrate the new solution into the organization’s operations.

## 1. Stakeholder Identification

The key processes involved in **stakeholder identification** are as follows:

1. **Identify Stakeholders:** The process of identifying stakeholders consists of identifying the individuals, groups, or organizations that may impact, are impacted by, or are perceived to be impacted by the proposed solution, as described in the project charter or vision statement.
2. **Identify Problem or Opportunity:** The real reason or root cause behind a problem or an opportunity is determined and documented in a situation statement. For example, for the LPR project, a situation statement might be:
    - Surveys reveal unhappy customers at toll payment lines. It is estimated that labor due to the lengthy service times at toll booths costs $500,000 each year.
3. **Conduct and Confirm Elicitation Results:** Business analysis and needs assessment involves eliciting information pertaining to the problem or opportunity from the identified stakeholder groups. It also requires checking the information gathered for accuracy and consistency with other secondary analysis and information.
4. **Examine Enterprise Organization:** Business analysis and needs assessment involves examining longer-term business needs, strategic direction, and enterprise architectures. For example, for the LPR project, a statement might be:
    - The quantity of vehicles will continue to rise as the city grows, further expanding the delays at physical toll barriers. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to simply increase staff to handle busy times because the busy times themselves will continue to increase in frequency and length. It would be more appropriate to re-examine options for new automation in toll collection activity so that vehicle throughput can actually increase while maintaining equal or possibly even reduced cost.
5. **Compile Stakeholder Register:** With sufficient analysis of the inputs just described, it is possible to compile a stakeholder register, which then makes stakeholder analysis more efficient. A stakeholder register is a comprehensive document that lists all the stakeholders involved in a project, along with their roles, interests, influence, and expectations. This register serves as a central repository of stakeholder information and is used to plan and manage stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle.
- The process of compiling a stakeholder register involves several key steps:
    1. **Identification**: Identifying all potential stakeholders by analyzing the project's scope, objectives, and impact. This includes internal stakeholders (such as team members and executives) and external stakeholders (such as customers, vendors, and regulatory bodies).
    2. **Classification**: Categorizing stakeholders based on their roles and characteristics. This helps in understanding the nature of their involvement and the type of engagement required. Common classifications include primary vs. secondary stakeholders, internal vs. external stakeholders, and direct vs. indirect stakeholders.
    3. **Analysis**: Assessing the level of influence and interest each stakeholder has in the project. Tools such as the power/interest grid or influence/impact matrix can be used to map stakeholders and prioritize them based on their significance to the project.
    4. **Documentation**: Recording detailed information about each stakeholder in the register. This includes their contact information, role in the project, level of influence, interests, expectations, and any specific concerns or requirements they may have.
    5. **Engagement Strategy**: Developing a tailored engagement strategy for each stakeholder or stakeholder group. This includes defining the communication methods, frequency, and key messages that will be used to keep stakeholders informed and engaged.
- By maintaining an up-to-date stakeholder register, project managers and business analysts can ensure that all stakeholders are appropriately considered and managed. This leads to more effective communication, better alignment of project goals with stakeholder expectations, and a higher likelihood of project success.

## 2. Conduct Stakeholder Analysis

**Stakeholder Analysis** - A process used to identify and assess the impact and influence of individuals, groups, or organizations that have a vested interest in the outcome of a project. The goal of stakeholder analysis is to develop a strategic approach to engaging stakeholders and addressing their needs and expectations.

The key components in **conduct stakeholder analysis are***:*

1. **Identification**: Identify all potential stakeholders by analyzing the project's scope, objectives, and impact. This includes internal stakeholders (such as team members and executives) and external stakeholders (such as customers, vendors, and regulatory bodies).
2. **Classification**: Categorize stakeholders based on their roles and characteristics. This helps in understanding the nature of their involvement and the type of engagement required. Common classifications include primary vs. secondary stakeholders, internal vs. external stakeholders, and direct vs. indirect stakeholders.
3. **Analysis**: Assess the level of influence and interest each stakeholder has in the project. Tools such as the power/interest grid or influence/impact matrix can be used to map stakeholders and prioritize them based on their significance to the project.
4. **Documentation**: Record detailed information about each stakeholder in the register. This includes their contact information, role in the project, level of influence, interests, expectations, and any specific concerns or requirements they may have.
5. **Engagement Strategy**: Develop a tailored engagement strategy for each stakeholder or stakeholder group. This includes defining the communication methods, frequency, and key messages that will be used to keep stakeholders informed and engaged.

The following tools and techniques are used to analyze stakeholders:

**Job analysis**: This technique is used to identify the job requirements and competencies required to perform a specific job or role. It involves a systematic process of collecting information about the duties, responsibilities, necessary skills, outcomes, and work environment of a particular job. The primary purpose of job analysis is to establish and document the 'job-relatedness' of employment procedures such as training, selection, compensation, and performance appraisal.

Job analysis process typically includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering information through various methods such as interviews, questionnaires, observations, and reviewing existing job descriptions and records.
2. **Job Description**: Creating a detailed job description that outlines the tasks, duties, and responsibilities of the job.
3. **Job Specifications**: Identifying the qualifications, skills, and competencies required to perform the job effectively.
4. **Job Context**: Understanding the work environment, including physical conditions, work hours, and any other relevant factors.
5. **Validation**: Ensuring the accuracy of the job analysis through feedback from employees and supervisors.
- Job analysis is crucial for human resource management as it helps in designing training programs, developing selection criteria, setting performance standards, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements. It also aids in organizational planning and development by identifying the skills and competencies needed for future growth and success.

**Persona analysis**: A persona is a fictional character created to represent an individual or a group of stakeholders, termed a user class. Personas are developed based on research and data about the users, including their goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations. The purpose of creating personas is to gain a deeper understanding of the users and to ensure that their needs and expectations are considered throughout the project.

Personas typically include:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, occupation, education level, and other relevant demographic details.
- **Goals and Objectives**: What the persona aims to achieve in relation to the product or service.
- **Behaviors**: How the persona interacts with the product or service, including usage patterns and habits.
- **Pain Points**: Challenges or problems the persona faces that the product or service can address.
- **Motivations**: Factors that drive the persona to use the product or service.
- **Quotes**: Direct quotes from actual users that illustrate their perspectives and experiences.
- By creating and using personas, business analysts, designers, and project managers can better align the project’s goals with user needs, leading to more user-centric solutions and improved user satisfaction.

**Stakeholder maps**: Stakeholder maps are visual representations used to identify and analyze the relationships, influence, and impact of various stakeholders in a project or organization. These maps help in understanding the stakeholders' interests, their level of influence, and their potential impact on the project's success.

Stakeholder maps can take several forms, including:

1. **Power/Interest Grid**: This matrix categorizes stakeholders based on their level of power (influence) and interest in the project. The grid is divided into four quadrants:
    - **High Power, High Interest**: These stakeholders are key players and should be **managed closely**. They have significant influence and a strong interest in the project's outcomes.
    - **High Power, Low Interest**: Stakeholders in this category have significant influence but may not be highly interested in the project's day-to-day activities. They should be kept **satisfied and informed** at a high level.
    - **Low Power, High Interest**: These stakeholders are interested in the project's outcomes but have limited influence. They should be kept **informed and engaged** to leverage their support.
    - **Low Power, Low Interest**: Stakeholders with minimal influence and interest. They require **minimal effort** but should not be ignored entirely.
2. **Influence/Impact Matrix**: Similar to the power/interest grid, this matrix categorizes stakeholders based on their level of influence and the impact the project will have on them. It helps prioritize stakeholder engagement and communication strategies.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement Matrix**: This matrix maps stakeholders' current and desired levels of engagement. It helps in identifying gaps and planning strategies to move stakeholders from their current engagement level to the desired level. Engagement levels can range from **unaware** to **resistant, neutral, supportive,** and **leading.**
4. **RACI matrix**: The RACI matrix is a tool used to delineate roles and responsibilities within a project or business process. The acronym RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.
    - **Responsible**: These are the individuals who actually complete the task. They are responsible for doing the work or making the decision. There should be at least one person with a "R" next to every task.
    - **Accountable**: This person is ultimately answerable for the task or decision. They ensure that the task is completed and make the final decision. There should only be one "A" assigned to each task.
    - **Consulted**: These are the people who provide input and feedback based on their expertise. They are typically consulted before a final decision is made or the task is completed.
    - **Informed**: These individuals are kept up-to-date on progress, decisions, and actions. They do not contribute directly to the task but need to be kept in the loop.
        - The RACI matrix helps in clarifying roles and responsibilities, ensuring that there is no ambiguity about who is responsible for what. It is particularly useful in complex projects with multiple stakeholders and can aid in improving communication, accountability, and decision-making processes.
        - To create a RACI matrix, a table is typically used where tasks or deliverables are listed in rows, and team members or stakeholder roles are listed in columns. Each cell in the table is then filled with one of the RACI designations to indicate the level of involvement for each role in each task.

## 3. Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach

**Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach** - This involves developing appropriate methods to engage and communicate with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. The goal is to ensure that stakeholders are informed, involved, and aligned with the project's objectives and progress. Effective stakeholder engagement and communication contribute to the project's success by building trust, managing expectations, and fostering collaboration.

Key components of **Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach** include:

1. **Stakeholder Communication Plan**: Develop a detailed communication plan that outlines how and when information will be shared with stakeholders. This includes identifying the communication channels, frequency, and content of the communication. The plan should be tailored to meet the needs and preferences of different stakeholder groups.
2. **Engagement Strategies**: Define strategies for engaging stakeholders at various stages of the project. This may include regular meetings, workshops, surveys, focus groups, and feedback sessions. The strategies should be designed to encourage active participation and ensure that stakeholders' voices are heard and considered.
3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly define the roles and responsibilities for stakeholder engagement and communication. This includes identifying who will be responsible for communicating with stakeholders, who will manage stakeholder relationships, and who will handle any issues or concerns that arise.
4. **Message Development**: Craft clear, consistent, and relevant messages for different stakeholder groups. The messages should address stakeholders' interests, concerns, and expectations, and provide them with the information they need to stay informed and engaged.
5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish mechanisms for collecting and responding to stakeholder feedback. This may include surveys, suggestion boxes, feedback forms, and dedicated communication channels. Ensuring that stakeholders can provide feedback and see that their input is valued helps build trust and support for the project.
6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement and communication efforts. This involves tracking communication activities, assessing stakeholder satisfaction, and making adjustments as needed to improve engagement and address any issues that arise.
7. **Cultural and Contextual Considerations**: Take into account the cultural and contextual factors that may influence stakeholder engagement and communication. This includes understanding cultural norms, language preferences, and any other factors that may impact how stakeholders receive and respond to communication.
8. **Conflict Resolution**: Develop approaches for resolving conflicts and addressing stakeholder concerns in a timely and constructive manner. This includes establishing clear processes for handling disputes, facilitating dialogue, and finding mutually acceptable solutions.

By implementing a well-defined **Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach**, project teams can build strong relationships with stakeholders, ensure alignment with project goals, and enhance the overall success of the project.

## 4. Business Analysis Planning

The process of **business analysis planning** involves understanding the scope of business analysis work and the roles, responsibilities, and skill sets required to start and successfully complete the requirements elicitation and analysis work. The outcome of this process is called the requirements management plan or the business analysis plan. The scope of this effort overlaps with project scope management, which is a core responsibility of the project manager.

Key components of **business analysis planning** include:

- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defining the boundaries of the business analysis activities. This includes identifying what is in scope and out of scope for the analysis work. A well-defined scope helps prevent scope creep and ensures that the analysis efforts are focused and relevant.
- **Stakeholder Identification and Analysis**: Identifying all stakeholders who will be involved in or affected by the business analysis activities. This involves understanding their roles, interests, influence, and expectations. Stakeholder analysis helps in developing effective communication and engagement strategies tailored to each stakeholder's needs.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Defining the roles and responsibilities of the business analyst and other team members involved in the business analysis work. This includes specifying who will be responsible for eliciting, documenting, analyzing, and managing requirements. Clear roles and responsibilities help in ensuring accountability and smooth collaboration.
- **Deliverables and Milestones**: Identifying the key deliverables that will be produced during the business analysis process, such as requirements documentation, business cases, and stakeholder registers. Establishing milestones helps in tracking progress and ensuring that the analysis work stays on schedule.
- **Approach and Methodology**: Selecting the appropriate approach and methodology for conducting business analysis, such as Agile, Waterfall, or a hybrid approach. This includes choosing the techniques and tools that will be used for eliciting, documenting, and managing requirements.
- **Requirements Gathering Techniques**: Determining the techniques that will be used to gather requirements from stakeholders. Common techniques include interviews, surveys, workshops, focus groups, observation, and document analysis. The choice of techniques depends on the project's context, stakeholder preferences, and the nature of the requirements.
- **Requirements Prioritization**: Establishing criteria and methods for prioritizing requirements based on factors such as business value, risk, feasibility, and stakeholder urgency. Prioritization ensures that the most critical requirements are addressed first and helps in making informed decisions when trade-offs are necessary.
- **Traceability and Management**: Implementing mechanisms to trace requirements throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that each requirement is tracked from elicitation to implementation and testing. Traceability helps in managing changes, validating requirements, and ensuring that the final solution meets the defined needs.
- **Change Management**: Developing a process for managing changes to requirements, including impact analysis, approval procedures, and updating documentation. Change management ensures that changes are systematically evaluated and incorporated without disrupting the project.
- **Verification and Validation**: Planning for the verification and validation of requirements to ensure that they are accurately captured and that the final solution meets the stakeholders' needs. This includes defining how requirements will be tested, reviewed, and approved.
- **Communication Plan**: Establishing a communication plan that outlines how information will be shared among stakeholders, including the frequency, methods, and content of communication. Effective communication is essential for keeping stakeholders informed, engaged, and aligned.

Having a well-defined **Business Analysis Plan** helps in aligning the project team and stakeholders, ensures clarity and transparency, and contributes to the successful delivery of the project. It provides a structured approach to managing requirements and helps in mitigating risks associated with misunderstandings and misaligned expectations.

## **5. Transition to a Future State**

The business analyst’s **final** act is to identify stakeholders that must be involved with the **transition to a future state** and obtain from them insights into the requirements and risks for the transition. This is a necessary change management planning effort that will assist all members of the project team—and the organization, for that matter—in making the transition to the new working approach successful.

**Transition to a Future State** - The process of moving an organization from its current state to a desired future state is a complex and multifaceted endeavor. This involves several critical activities to ensure successful transformation and long-term sustainability. Here are the key components and steps involved:

1. **Vision and Goal Setting**: Clearly define the future state vision and the organizational goals that the transition aims to achieve. This involves aligning the vision with the strategic objectives of the organization and ensuring that all stakeholders understand and support the desired outcomes.
2. **Gap Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the differences between the current state and the future state. This includes evaluating existing processes, systems, capabilities, and resources to determine what needs to change to achieve the future state.
3. **Change Management Planning**: Develop a comprehensive change management plan that addresses the human side of the transition. This includes strategies for communication, training, and support to help employees adapt to new processes, technologies, and ways of working. Change management should also address resistance to change and provide mechanisms for feedback and continuous improvement.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Identify and engage key stakeholders throughout the transition process. This involves understanding their needs, concerns, and expectations, and ensuring that they are involved in decision-making and kept informed about progress. Effective stakeholder engagement helps build support and reduces resistance to the transition.
5. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate the necessary resources, including budget, personnel, and technology, to support the transition. Ensure that resources are available and properly managed to avoid bottlenecks and delays.
6. **Risk Management**: Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to address them. This includes assessing the impact of the transition on various aspects of the organization and implementing measures to minimize disruptions and ensure business continuity.
7. **Implementation Planning**: Develop a detailed implementation plan that outlines the specific steps, timelines, and milestones for achieving the future state. This plan should include clear roles and responsibilities, as well as mechanisms for monitoring progress and making adjustments as needed.
8. **Training and Development**: Provide training and development opportunities to equip employees with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the future state. This includes both technical training on new systems and processes, as well as soft skills training to support effective collaboration and communication.
9. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuously monitor the progress of the transition and evaluate the outcomes against the defined goals and objectives. This involves collecting and analyzing data, soliciting feedback from stakeholders, and making necessary adjustments to ensure that the transition stays on track and delivers the desired benefits.
10. **Sustainability and Continuous Improvement**: Ensure that the changes implemented during the transition are sustainable and embedded into the organization's culture and operations. Establish mechanisms for continuous improvement to maintain momentum and drive ongoing innovation and growth.

The ultimate goal of transitioning to a future state is to integrate the new solution seamlessly into the organization's operations, ensuring that it meets the business needs and objectives. By following a structured and strategic approach, organizations can navigate the complexities of change and achieve lasting success.

## Business Analysis in the Adaptive Approach

In an adaptive approach, business analysis is conducted in a flexible and iterative manner, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation to changing business needs and project conditions. This approach contrasts with the more traditional, predictive methods where requirements are defined upfront and fixed throughout the project lifecycle. The adaptive approach is particularly suited for projects characterized by high uncertainty, complexity, and evolving requirements, such as those found in software development or innovative product design.

One of the key principles of business analysis in the adaptive approach is incremental delivery. Requirements are broken down into smaller, manageable components that can be developed, tested, and delivered in short cycles or iterations. This allows for early and frequent delivery of value to the stakeholders and provides opportunities for feedback and course corrections. Business analysts work closely with stakeholders throughout the project to continuously gather and refine requirements based on the latest insights and feedback. This ensures that the delivered solution remains aligned with the business objectives and user needs.

Collaboration is another critical aspect of the adaptive approach. Business analysts, project managers, developers, and other team members work together in a highly collaborative environment. Regular communication and interaction with stakeholders are essential to understand their evolving needs and to keep them engaged in the process. Techniques such as workshops, daily stand-ups, and review meetings are commonly used to facilitate this collaboration. The adaptive approach also emphasizes the use of visual tools and artifacts, such as user stories, prototypes, and backlogs, to capture and communicate requirements effectively.

Finally, the adaptive approach places a strong emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness to change. Unlike the predictive approach, where changes to requirements can be costly and time-consuming, the adaptive approach is designed to accommodate changes efficiently. Business analysts are expected to embrace changes as opportunities to improve the solution rather than as disruptions. This mindset, coupled with the iterative nature of the approach, enables the project team to pivot and adapt quickly to new information and changing circumstances, ultimately leading to a more successful and relevant outcome for the business.
# Build a High-Performance Project Team

As we have detailed the science of project management in previous chapters, there has been an unspoken assumption: that the people on the project team would work together in harmony to build plans, manage risks, perform tasks, and commit themselves to achieving the clearly stated goals of the project. But that is not always the case.

Despite detailed plans and frequent status meetings, some teams don't work well together. Most of us, at one time or another, experience the frustration of teamwork that is characterized by bickering, unproductive meetings, and a joyless plodding as the project falls further and further behind. If that challenge isn't enough, consider that project teams are temporary, existing only for the duration of the project—how can we expect the team members to commit to the success of this project? It is no secret that the science of project management cannot create successful projects without the committed, cooperative work of a cohesive team.

To discuss this topic thoroughly, we must begin with a basic definition of a team: “a group of people working interdependently to produce an outcome for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.” Project teams have another characteristic: They will be temporary, formed specifically for the purpose of achieving the goal, after which they will disband.

### The Importance of Project Team Dynamics

A weak, uncooperative team isn’t just *unproductive;* it can make your job a daily grind of frustration and resentment. People burn out, blow up, or quit their jobs because of negative interpersonal dynamics on teams. Conversely, many people cite the strength of a team or their terrific teammates when recounting how they survived a project when everything seemed to go wrong. 

Of all the topics in this book, this chapter has the greatest potential to change the daily work experience for you and your team.

### Team Building Is Every Project Leader’s Responsibility

Every project team needs its leader to consciously invest in building a strong, cohesive, capable team. Whether or not the project manager gets to choose the team members, it is their responsibility to optimize their performance. Team building is every bit as essential as project definition and planning.

### The Challenge of Building Project Teams

Building a successful project team is no small feat. It involves selecting the right mix of skills, personalities, and experiences to ensure that the team can work together effectively. Project leaders must also foster an environment of trust and open communication, where team members feel valued and heard. Additionally, they need to navigate the complexities of team dynamics, manage conflicts, and keep the team focused on the project goals. All of these tasks require a high level of emotional intelligence and leadership skills, making team building one of the most challenging aspects of project management.

### A Framework for Building High-Performance Teams

So far we've established the importance of a strong team and the challenges of creating one. But what, exactly, do we mean by a high‐performance team? In this section we examine the attributes of such a team and present a model that will help us build one.

High‐performance teams are more than merely highly productive. A team composed of experienced, capable people can be very productive until those people hit an obstacle or are confronted with an unexpected challenge. This is the point at which the team either shows its strength or reveals its limitations.

![Untitled](Untitled%2033.png)

The three primary components in our model—*positive team culture*, *collaborative problem‐solving*, and *leadership*—are introduced here with their component parts. Each part is described in detail later in the chapter.

### Positive Team Culture

A positive team culture is the foundation of a high-performance team. It encompasses shared values, mutual respect, and a sense of belonging among team members. When a team has a positive culture, members are more likely to support one another, communicate openly, and strive for collective success. This environment fosters trust and encourages members to share their ideas without fear of judgment. Key aspects of a positive team culture include trust, inclusivity, and recognition of individual contributions. Additionally, a positive culture promotes teamwork and collaboration, which are vital for achieving the team's goals. Celebrating successes together and learning from failures collectively are also integral to maintaining a positive team culture.

### Collaborative Problem-Solving

Collaborative problem-solving is essential for addressing the challenges and obstacles that arise during a project. High-performance teams leverage the diverse skills and perspectives of their members to find innovative solutions. This process involves active listening, constructive feedback, and a willingness to consider different viewpoints. The act of brainstorming together allows team members to explore various solutions and choose the best course of action. Effective collaborative problem-solving enhances the team's ability to adapt and overcome difficulties, thereby maintaining progress toward project goals. Moreover, it fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among team members, as they are all involved in the decision-making process.

### Leadership

Leadership plays a crucial role in guiding a high-performance team. Effective leaders set clear expectations, provide direction, and foster an environment where team members feel motivated and empowered. They also manage conflicts, facilitate communication, and ensure that the team remains focused on its objectives. Strong leadership is characterized by emotional intelligence, the ability to inspire, and a commitment to the team's success. Leaders must also be adaptable, able to change their approach as the situation demands, and always open to feedback from their team. By recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, effective leaders can assign tasks that maximize productivity and foster personal growth. Additionally, strong leaders act as mentors, helping to develop the skills and confidence of their team members.

# Agile Development With Scrum

How do we manage these not‐quite‐projects? Agile is a framework for incremental delivery, particularly in software. It consists of techniques that allow for repeating the cycle of requirements‐design‐develop‐test‐deliver. One of these techniques is Scrum. Scrum is a management approach designed for incremental delivery.

**Scrum** is an agile *framework* for managing work with an emphasis on software development. It is designed to deliver small, usable increments of a project through iterative cycles called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. Scrum involves roles such as the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, and ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. The framework is centered around transparency, inspection, and adaptation to ensure continuous improvement and value delivery.

- Scrum belongs in a book on project management because more organizations are managing changes with incremental delivery, and not just software projects. The principles and techniques of Scrum have been proven in purely agile, incremental development efforts. In a world of increasing change, any practitioner of project management that understands Scrum will see opportunities where these techniques present an alternative approach to planning and managing work.

A **framework** is a set of guidelines or best practices that can be adapted to different situations, providing a flexible approach to solving problems. It offers a structure within which various methods can be applied, allowing teams to tailor their processes to their specific needs.

On the other hand, a **methodology** is a more rigid, systematic approach that prescribes specific steps and procedures to be followed in a particular order. It is often more detailed and prescriptive, leaving less room for adaptation.

Scrum is considered a *framework* because it provides a flexible structure that teams can adapt to their unique contexts. It outlines roles, ceremonies, and artifacts but does not dictate exactly how to execute each task. This flexibility allows teams to continuously inspect and adapt their processes to improve performance and deliver value efficiently.

### Scrum Roles

1. **Scrum Master**: The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring the team adheres to Scrum practices and principles. They act as a facilitator, helping to remove obstacles that may hinder the team's progress. The Scrum Master also ensures that Scrum ceremonies are conducted efficiently and that the team remains focused on their goals.
2. **Product Owner**: The Product Owner is responsible for defining the features and functionalities of the product. They manage the product backlog, prioritize items based on business value, and ensure that the team understands the requirements. The Product Owner represents the stakeholders' interests and ensures that the product delivers value to the users.
3. **Development Team**: The Development Team consists of professionals who work on delivering the product increment. They are cross-functional, meaning they have all the skills needed to create a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each sprint. The team is self-organizing and decides how to accomplish their work without external interference.

Each of these roles is essential for the successful implementation of Scrum, ensuring that the team can deliver value through iterative and incremental development.

### Scrum Ceremonies

1. **Sprint Planning**: This ceremony marks the beginning of a sprint and is crucial for setting the stage for the work ahead. During sprint planning, the entire team collaborates to decide what work will be accomplished in the upcoming sprint. The Product Owner presents the prioritized backlog items, which include user stories, tasks, and features that need to be developed. The team discusses these items in detail, estimates the effort required, and commits to the tasks they believe can be completed within the sprint timeframe. This meeting helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and sets clear expectations for the sprint.
2. **Daily Stand-up**: Also known as the Daily Scrum, this is a short, time-boxed meeting (usually 15 minutes) held every day. During this meeting, team members share what they accomplished the previous day, what they plan to work on today, and any obstacles or impediments they are facing. This ceremony promotes transparency and keeps the team aligned and informed about each other's progress. It also provides a regular opportunity to identify and address any issues that could hinder the sprint's progress, fostering a collaborative and supportive team environment.
3. **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review to showcase the work completed during the sprint. The Product Owner, stakeholders, and other team members participate in this meeting to review the product increment, which is a potentially shippable piece of software. During the sprint review, the team demonstrates the new features and functionalities added, gathers feedback from stakeholders, and discusses any changes needed. This ceremony ensures that the product remains aligned with business goals and user needs, allowing for adjustments to be made based on real-world feedback and insights.
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: Following the sprint review, the team conducts a sprint retrospective to reflect on the sprint process. During this meeting, they identify what went well, what didn't go well, and what could be improved. The goal is to promote continuous improvement by making actionable changes for future sprints. The retrospective provides a safe space for team members to voice their thoughts and suggestions, fostering a culture of openness and constant learning. By addressing issues and implementing improvements, the team can enhance their efficiency, collaboration, and overall performance in subsequent sprints.

### Scrum Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog**: The product backlog is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done for the product. It is dynamic and constantly evolving as new requirements, changes, and feedback are incorporated. The Product Owner is responsible for managing the product backlog.
2. **Release Backlog**: The release backlog is a subset of the product backlog that includes all the work items planned for a specific release. It contains detailed descriptions of features, user stories, bug fixes, and other tasks that need to be completed for the release. The Product Owner collaborates with stakeholders to prioritize these items based on their business value and the strategic goals of the release. The release backlog helps ensure that the most critical and valuable features are developed and delivered within the planned release timeframe, aligning the development efforts with the overall product vision and user needs.
3. **Sprint Backlog**: The sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog items that the team commits to completing in a sprint. It includes the tasks needed to deliver the selected product backlog items. The Development Team manages the sprint backlog and updates it daily.
4. **Increment**: The increment is the sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint, along with the value of all previous increments. It must be in a usable condition and meet the team's definition of "done." The increment is the tangible outcome of the sprint and represents progress toward the final product.

### Definition of Done

The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a shared understanding within the Scrum team of what it means for a product backlog item to be considered complete. It ensures that all team members have a common understanding of the quality and completeness criteria. The DoD may include criteria such as code reviews, testing, documentation, and user acceptance. Having a clear DoD promotes consistency, quality, and transparency in the team's work.

### Benefits of Using Scrum

1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Scrum allows teams to quickly adapt to changes in requirements, technology, and market conditions. The iterative nature of sprints enables continuous feedback and improvement.
2. **Improved Collaboration**: Scrum fosters collaboration and communication within the team and with stakeholders. Regular ceremonies and transparent processes ensure that everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.
3. **Increased Productivity**: By breaking down work into manageable sprints and focusing on delivering small increments, Scrum helps teams maintain a steady pace and avoid burnout. The emphasis on prioritization ensures that the most valuable work is completed first.
4. **Higher Quality**: The definition of done, regular reviews, and retrospectives help maintain a high standard of quality throughout the development process. Continuous testing and feedback loops ensure that issues are identified and addressed early.
5. **Customer Satisfaction**: Scrum's focus on delivering value incrementally ensures that the end product meets user needs and expectations. Frequent reviews and feedback loops allow for adjustments based on user input, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

### Managing the Product Backlog

Managing the product backlog is a crucial responsibility of the Product Owner in the Scrum framework. The product backlog is a dynamic and prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done for the product, including features, enhancements, bug fixes, technical debt, and other tasks. Effective product backlog management involves several key activities:

1. **Prioritization**: The Product Owner must continuously prioritize backlog items based on their business value, user needs, and strategic goals. High-priority items are placed at the top of the backlog, ensuring that the team focuses on delivering the most valuable features first.
2. **Refinement**: Regular backlog refinement sessions (also known as backlog grooming) are held to review and update the backlog. During these sessions, the Product Owner, along with the Development Team, discusses the details of upcoming items, estimates their effort, and breaks down larger items into smaller, more manageable tasks. This process helps keep the backlog up-to-date and ensures that items are well-defined and ready for sprint planning.
3. **Estimation**: The Development Team estimates the effort required for each backlog item, often using techniques like story points, t-shirt sizing, or time-based estimates. Accurate estimates help the team plan their work effectively and set realistic expectations for delivery.
4. **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The Product Owner collaborates with stakeholders, including customers, users, and business leaders, to gather feedback and understand their needs and priorities. This ongoing communication ensures that the backlog reflects the latest insights and requirements, aligning the product development with business objectives.
5. **Transparency**: The product backlog should be transparent and accessible to all team members and stakeholders. This visibility fosters trust and collaboration, allowing everyone to understand the current priorities and the rationale behind them. Tools like digital boards or project management software can help maintain and share the backlog effectively.
6. **Adaptability**: The product backlog is not a static document; it evolves as new information and feedback are received. The Product Owner must be adaptable and willing to adjust priorities and add or remove items based on changing circumstances. This flexibility allows the team to respond to new opportunities and challenges effectively.
7. **Definition of Ready**: To ensure that backlog items are actionable, the team may establish a "Definition of Ready" (DoR). This set of criteria defines when a backlog item is considered ready for development, including clear acceptance criteria, necessary details, and appropriate estimates. Adhering to the DoR helps prevent ambiguity and ensures that the team can start working on items without delays.

By effectively managing the product backlog, the Product Owner ensures that the team works on the most valuable and relevant tasks, maximizing the product's impact and aligning development efforts with business goals.

### Task Boards

A **Task Board** is a visual tool used in Scrum to track the progress of tasks within a sprint. It helps the team visualize their workflow and monitor the status of work items. The Task Board typically consists of columns representing different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each task or user story is represented by a card that moves across the columns as work progresses.

- **To Do**: This column contains tasks that have been planned for the sprint but have not yet been started. It represents the work that the team needs to complete within the sprint.
- **In Progress**: This column includes tasks that are currently being worked on by team members. It shows what the team is actively working on at any given time.
- **Done**: This column lists tasks that have been completed and meet the team's Definition of Done. It represents the work that has been finished during the sprint.

Task Boards provide several benefits:

- **Transparency**: They offer a clear, visual representation of the team's progress, making it easy to see what has been completed and what remains to be done.
- **Collaboration**: They facilitate communication and collaboration among team members by providing a shared view of the work.
- **Focus**: They help the team stay focused on the tasks at hand and avoid getting distracted by unrelated work.
- **Accountability**: They promote accountability by making it visible who is working on what and how tasks are progressing.

### Burndown Charts

A **Burndown Chart** is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. It is used in Scrum to track the progress of a sprint and ensure that the team is on track to complete their work by the end of the sprint. The Burndown Chart shows the amount of remaining work (usually measured in story points or hours) on the vertical axis and the time (days of the sprint) on the horizontal axis.

- **Ideal Line**: The chart includes an ideal line that represents a perfectly linear progression towards completing all tasks by the end of the sprint. It serves as a benchmark for the team's progress.
- **Actual Line**: The actual line on the chart represents the real progress of the team. It is updated daily to reflect the amount of work remaining.

Burndown Charts provide several benefits:

- **Progress Tracking**: They allow the team to quickly see if they are ahead or behind schedule, helping them make informed decisions about their work.
- **Forecasting**: They help forecast whether the team is likely to complete the sprint backlog by the end of the sprint, allowing for early identification of potential issues.
- **Motivation**: They can motivate the team by showing visible progress towards their goals, fostering a sense of accomplishment.
- **Adaptation**: They enable the team to adapt their plans based on their progress, such as reallocating tasks or adjusting priorities to stay on track.

By using Task Boards and Burndown Charts, Scrum teams can effectively manage their work, stay aligned with their goals, and continuously improve their processes to deliver value efficiently.

### Intersection Between Scrum and Project Management

Scrum and traditional project management may seem distinct, but they share several common goals and principles, making their intersection highly relevant in today's dynamic work environments. Both aim to deliver valuable outcomes, ensure effective resource utilization, and foster collaboration among team members. Here’s how Scrum intersects with project management:

1. **Incremental Delivery**: Traditional project management often involves delivering a project in phases, while Scrum delivers small, usable increments through sprints. Both approaches emphasize breaking down work into manageable parts, enabling continuous progress and reducing risks.
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Both Scrum and project management prioritize engaging stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. Scrum does this through ceremonies like sprint reviews and planning sessions, while traditional project management involves stakeholder meetings and status reports to ensure alignment and gather feedback.
3. **Adaptability and Flexibility**: Scrum’s iterative cycles and focus on continuous improvement align well with the adaptive approaches in modern project management. Both methodologies encourage teams to respond to changes and new information, allowing for adjustments that keep the project on track and aligned with business goals.
4. **Team Collaboration**: Effective collaboration is essential in both Scrum and traditional project management. Scrum promotes collaboration through daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, while project management encourages teamwork through regular meetings, communication plans, and collaborative tools.
5. **Transparency and Visibility**: Scrum’s use of artifacts like task boards and burndown charts provides transparency into the team's progress and workflow. Similarly, project management relies on tools like Gantt charts, progress reports, and dashboards to maintain visibility and track project status.
6. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Scrum defines specific roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, each with clear responsibilities. Traditional project management also delineates roles such as project manager, team members, and stakeholders, ensuring accountability and clarity in task execution.
7. **Quality Assurance**: Scrum’s Definition of Done and regular sprint reviews help maintain high quality. In project management, quality assurance processes and standards ensure that deliverables meet the required specifications and stakeholder expectations.
8. **Risk Management**: Both methodologies recognize the importance of identifying and mitigating risks. Scrum’s iterative approach allows for early detection and resolution of issues, while traditional project management involves risk assessment, planning, and monitoring to handle uncertainties effectively.

By understanding the intersection between Scrum and project management, practitioners can leverage the strengths of both approaches to enhance project delivery, foster better collaboration, and achieve higher customer satisfaction. Integrating Scrum practices into traditional project management frameworks can lead to more adaptive, responsive, and successful project outcomes.

# Adaptive Methodologies

All types of projects, including compliance and nonprofit projects, generate business value, and are *systems of value delivery*. Adaptive projects lend themselves well to a value-driven paradigm — what we might label as the “early delivery of what the customer wants” paradigm. 

> Practices such as *customer-valued prioritization, risk-adjusted backlogs, product roadmaps,* and *incremental delivery* are all unique to the adaptive, value-driven approach.
> 

### Adaptive Mindset

The Agile Manifesto is simple in structure and sparse in words, and it introduces **four** values:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

These values emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and delivering functional software over rigid processes and extensive documentation. Here is an elaboration on each of these values:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:**
    - This value highlights the importance of human communication and collaboration. Agile methodologies prioritize face-to-face conversation and teamwork over strict adherence to processes or reliance on tools. The belief is that effective communication among team members leads to better problem-solving and innovation, ultimately driving project success.
2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation:**
    - Agile methodologies focus on delivering functional software that meets user needs rather than producing extensive documentation. While some documentation is necessary, agile teams aim to create just enough documentation to support the development process and use working software as the primary measure of progress. This approach ensures that the team remains focused on delivering value to the customer.
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:**
    - Agile emphasizes close collaboration with customers throughout the project lifecycle. Instead of rigidly following a pre-defined contract, agile teams work with customers to understand their evolving needs and make adjustments as necessary. This ongoing collaboration helps ensure that the final product aligns with customer expectations and delivers maximum value.
4. **Responding to change over following a plan:**
    - Agile methodologies recognize that change is inevitable and often beneficial. Rather than sticking to a fixed plan, agile teams embrace change and adapt their plans as new information and insights emerge. This flexibility allows the team to respond to changing market conditions, customer feedback, and other factors, ensuring that the project remains relevant and valuable.

---

An **adaptive mindset** refers to the ability to remain flexible and open to change in response to evolving conditions and new information. It emphasizes continuous learning, collaboration, and responsiveness to feedback, allowing individuals and teams to effectively navigate and thrive in dynamic environments. This mindset is particularly valuable in contexts where requirements and priorities frequently change, such as in adaptive or agile project management.

**Product Owner** - The product owner is a key stakeholder in an agile project who has a clear vision of the final product. They are responsible for providing product-related information, prioritizing the product backlog, and working closely with the project team to ensure that the product meets the desired outcomes and delivers value to the customers.

A **servant leader** is a leader who prioritizes the needs of their team members and organization over their own personal ambitions. They focus on empowering and uplifting others, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. Key characteristics of a servant leader include empathy, active listening, stewardship, and a commitment to the growth and well-being of their team. This leadership style is especially prevalent in agile and adaptive project management environments, where collaboration and team cohesion are critical to success.

**Servant leadership behaviors** include:

- **Obstacle removal**: Because the project team generates the most business value, a critical role for a servant leader is to maximize delivery by removing impediments to progress. This includes solving problems and removing obstacles that may be hampering the project team’s work. Solving or easing these impediments enables the project team to deliver value to the business faster.
- **Diversion shield:** Servant leaders protect the project team from internal and external diversions that redirect the project team from the current objectives. Time fragmentation reduces productivity, and shielding the project team from noncritical external demands helps the project team stay focused.
- **Encouragement and development**: The servant leader provides tools and encouragement to keep the project team satisfied and productive. Learning what motivates project team members as individuals and finding ways to reward them for good work all help to keep project team members satisfied.

The concept of **delivery cadence** involves the rhythm of a project — the frequency of producing some deliverable. 

**Timeboxing** is a project management technique where a fixed time period is allocated for an activity. This approach is often used in agile project management to ensure that tasks do not exceed the estimated time and helps to keep the project on schedule.

### Factors that Facilitate Adaptive Approaches

**Organizational Process Assets** refer to the set of procedures, historical information, and knowledge gathered from previous projects that can be used to aid in the planning and execution of current and future projects. These assets may include templates, lessons learned, and process documentation.

**Enterprise Environmental Factors** refer to the conditions, not under the immediate control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. These factors could be internal, such as organizational culture and structure, or external, such as market conditions and government regulations.

**Internal environment** factors are factors internal to an organization that can arise from within the organization. Examples are a portfolio, a program, another project, or a combination of internal knowledge, artifacts, and practices

**External environment** factors are factors external to the organization that can enhance, constrain, or have a neutral influence on project outcomes

# Apparent Stages of Adaptive Projects

While there is no standard or recommended approach for naming the stages, we see three apparent stages of Adaptive Projects:

1. Concept
2. Construct and Deliver
3. Close

![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)

## Stage 1: Concept

The **Concept** stage is the ideation phase of the project, as shown in Figure 7-9. It requires working closely with the business team, developers, and customers. At this stage, a stakeholder (typically called the product owner) working with project sponsors provides details of the requirements and creates a vision statement for the final product. The focus of this artifact is the business benefits and the scope of the project overall. Requirements do not have to be detailed because they can be modified in later stages.

![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)

- **Vision Statement -** In adaptive projects, the vision has to be simple, not detailed with specifications. Even for a complex project, the vision statement can be simple. The PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition, Section 2.2.4.1, states that the project vision summarizes the project’s purpose clearly and succinctly. **It describes a realistic, attractive view of the future project outcomes. In addition to briefly describing the desired future state, the vision is a powerful motivational tool. It provides a way to create passion and meaning for a project’s envisioned goal. A common vision helps keep people pulling in the same direction**. When team members are immersed in the details of everyday work, a clear understanding of the end goal can help guide local decisions toward the desired project outcome.
    - There are many types of popular **vision formats**. We describe **three** of them:
        - **Elevator statement**: Say that you step into an elevator on the way up to a meeting, and a key stakeholder in the elevator asks about the project. In 30 seconds, you should be able to tell that stakeholder the purpose of the project and the best achievable outcome.
        - **Press release vision statement**: A related approach to the elevator statement is the press release vision statement. In this approach, you assume that the product is now available and conjecture what a press release should say about it.
        - **Product vision board or project datasheet**: The product vision board or project datasheet answers several questions:
            - What is the project purpose?
            - What is the target group?
            - What are the benefits?
            - What are the achievable outcomes?
- **Product Roadmap -** A product roadmap outlines a product’s vision, direction, priorities, and progress over time. It enables you to design and visualize features that will be in the final product. **A product roadmap is a live and evolving tool for planning, organizing, and delivering the product**. The product owner is responsible for providing all the necessary product-related information to the team. The team will use the roadmap as a guide for all day-to-day work and to explore the future product functionality.

## Stage 2: Construct and Deliver

The **Construct and Deliver** stage involves iterations that deliver **increments** of work prioritized by the product owner. It also involves demonstration to stakeholders and feedback from customers, as illustrated in Figure 7-7.

- **Increment -** A Scrum artifact that defines the complete and valuable work produced by developers during a sprint. The sum of all increments forms a product.

![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)

- The activities of the **Planning Performance Domain** for adaptive projects are best characterized as follows:
    - Collect and decompose requirements.
    - Estimate effort.
    - Create a prioritized product backlog.
    - Create a timetable to deliver in iterations (in a process known as release planning).

### Collect and Decompose Requirements

Projects that use iterative or incremental approaches can have **high-level themes**, such as website security, or **epics**, such as sign-ups for events, that are decomposed into *features*, which are then further decomposed into **user stories.**

- **High-level themes** - Overarching goals or areas of focus that guide the development of a project. Examples include improving user experience, enhancing security, and increasing system performance.
- **Epics** - In project management, especially in software development, an epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks called user stories. Epics are essentially a collection of tasks that all contribute toward a common goal.
- **User Stories** - A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. This helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.
    - Each user story communicates a single action. User stories are actionable and small enough to fit into an iteration.

### Develop a Release Plan

The **adaptive approach** to planning is unique in many ways. For example, there is high client involvement and user requirements change. This results in an iterative structure. The entire team’s focus is to identify and deliver the most valuable features at all times. This is known as delivering a [**minimum viable product (MVP)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/certified-associate-in/9780137918102/glo1.xhtml#gloss1_122),** which essentially identifies the fewest number of features or requirements that are both functional and usable. It is important to distinguish between the concepts of iterative development and incremental development. [**Iterative development**](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/certified-associate-in/9780137918102/glo1.xhtml#gloss1_107) is a development approach that focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, followed by future progressive elaboration that adds to the features until the final deliverable is complete. [**Incremental development**](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/certified-associate-in/9780137918102/glo1.xhtml#gloss1_094) focuses on releasing fully functional features in successive increments until the final deliverable is complete.

- The product owner creates a **release plan**, which establishes the iterations. This plan describes a high-level timetable for the release of product features. An adaptive project will have many releases, with the highest-priority features launching first. Working with the team, the product owner creates a release plan at the beginning of each release.
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** - This is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.
- **Iterative Development** - This is a development approach that begins with a simplified implementation of only a subset of the software requirements. Then, additional details and functionality are added in iterations until the full system is implemented.
- **Incremental Development** - This is a method where the project is broken down into smaller, manageable segments. Each segment, known as an increment, is developed, implemented, and tested separately. This approach allows for partial delivery of the final product, providing stakeholders with functioning portions of the project at various stages. It involves both development and maintenance stages, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation based on feedback.

### Create a Product Backlog

An important outcome of the **product roadmap** is creation of the **product backlog**. 

- A **product backlog** is a prioritized list of features, deliverables, and requirements for a project. It serves as a reference for the team at the start of each iteration, helping them identify which tasks to implement. In the context of agile or adaptive projects, user stories with vertical layers usually form a good product backlog.

> **Note**: It is important not to fill the backlog with tasks rather than user requirements or features. Detailed task-related activities such as WBS packages should not be in the product backlog.
> 

---

### Estimate Effort with Story Points

Some unique methods can be used for estimating adaptive projects. The following definitions are relevant to estimating in adaptive projects. 

**Story points** are a unitless measure used in agile project management for relative estimation of the size, complexity, and effort required for user stories. They allow teams to compare and rank-order user stories by considering these attributes, facilitating planning and prioritization in adaptive projects.

**Absolute estimates:** these generate explicit actual quantities (for example, “the prototype will take 120 hours to complete”).

**Relative estimates:** these are shown in comparison to other estimates and have meaning only within a given context. A common way to describe relative estimates for user stories in adaptive projects is through assigning a relative quantity of **story points.** Though a story points sounds like a unit of measure, it actually is not. **It is a unitless measure in which the comparison of value is used for relative estimation in sizing and comparing**. If a team can produce an estimate in hours for just one of the user stories, the comparative number of story points can be used to establish likely time estimates for the other stories. 

Adaptive estimation begins with a list of user stories and team members participating in the estimation process. Everyone, including the product owner and external experts, is invited to review all the user stories and rank-order them, keeping three attributes in mind: size, complexity, and uncertainty:

![Untitled](Untitled%207.png)

### Plan Iterations

**Iteration planning** sessions take place at the start of each iteration. During such a session, the project team reviews the requirements of the upcoming iteration. What results from *iteration planning* is a high-level release iteration plan that indicates the basic features and functionality to be included in each release*.* 

- **Iteration planning** is a session that takes place at the start of each iteration during a project. During this session, the project team reviews the requirements of the upcoming iteration. The result of iteration planning is a high-level release iteration plan that outlines the basic features and functionality to be included in each release.

When the user stories associated with the iteration are confirmed, the development team breaks those requirements into smaller tasks. **The process of decomposition is similar to what is done to create a work breakdown structure (WBS) and is used to create tasks for adaptive projects**. At this point, the team can optionally assign hourly estimates for each task. This becomes the tasks backlog. This breakdown and estimation process is illustrated in Figure 7-13.

![Untitled](Untitled%208.png)

The development team should ensure that the tasks address the **definition of done (DoD)** criteria. DoD refers to a shared understanding within the development team of what it takes to make the user story, feature, or product incrementable to be released.

The team members can assess their task estimation skills and work capacity at the end of the iteration, usually during a lessons learned retrospective meeting. This evaluation will yield accurate velocity or capacity of the team to deliver user points.

- The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a shared understanding within the development team about what criteria a user story, feature, or product increment must meet to be considered complete and ready for release. It provides clear and specific expectations that help ensure a consistent level of quality across deliverables.

### Project Work and Delivery Performance Domains

In adaptive projects, planning as well as Construct and Deliver functions are executed during each iteration. Key activities involve:

- Brief daily team meetings (often called standup meetings)
- **Iteration review**, in which the team demonstrates the working product created during the iteration to the stakeholders
- A **lessons learned retrospective** at the end of each iteration in which the team discusses how the iteration went and plans for improvements in the next iteration

### Exiting the Construct and Deliver Stage

In summary, the activities involved in the **Construct and Deliver** stage include the following:

- Recognize an iteration goal and identify tasks to complete the iteration. Artifacts documenting these planning activities should be completed. Exit criteria will be reviewed at a planning stage gate review before the next phase of development begins.
- Execute the tasks of the iteration.
- Review the results of the iteration.
- If approved by the stakeholders, release increments to customers.
- Gather lessons learned from the iteration.
- Refine the backlog and continue to the next iteration until all iterations are completed.

[Refine the Backlog?](Refine%20the%20Backlog%2098aad4c46cc74bf5b633acaae82a2035.md)

## Stage 3: Close

Due to the incremental delivery nature of an adaptive project, projects might not close as abruptly as they do in predictive plan-based development approaches. However, this stage represents the ending of the iterations. The product as developed so far is successfully delivered and is in operation. **This stage takes place periodically as deliverables are completed, and then an overall project close is carried out when the overall product vision has been attained.**

![Untitled](Untitled%209.png)

In this stage, **retrospectives**, or **lessons learned**, for each deliverable are completed, and project personnel (including contractors) may be released if they are no longer needed for subsequent work. When the entire project is done, *information from the various stage-gate reviews and an overall evaluation of project performance compared to baselines are conducted*. **Finally**, the project charter and the business case are reviewed to determine whether the deliverables achieved the intended benefits, value, and vision.

In many ways, the following work groups or phases for adaptive projects are similar to the overall process groups for predictive projects. Drawing comparisons between the two approaches, we could say that adaptive project work groups/stages would consist of:

- Initiate the project
- Build a team
- Plan, construct, and deliver
- Stay on track (monitor and control)
- Deliver benefits (and close)

---

## Agile Life Cycles

The term **agile** was defined earlier as a mindset of values and principles as set forth in the Agile Manifesto. 

Agile approaches and agile methods are broad terms that cover a variety of frameworks and methods. 

**Agile life cycles** are a special case of adaptive life cycles. If an adaptive life cycle demonstrates characteristics of both I**teration** and **incremental delivery,** it is regarded as an *agile life cycle.*

A goal of agile life cycles is to uncover hidden or misunderstood requirements. In an agile environment, the team expects requirements to change. The iterative and incremental approaches provide feedback to better the plan the next part of the project. 

![Untitled](Untitled%2010.png)

Therefore, a summary of **agile life cycle** features follows:

- Agile life cycles explore feasibility in fixed, short cycles called **sprints**.
- Delivery occurs frequently, and requirements are elaborated.
- Agile life cycles require the project team to evaluate and receive feedback.
- Agile life cycles feature both **iterative** and **incremental** development.
- A key stakeholder who has a vision of the final product (known as the product owner) is continuously involved and works closely with the project team.

### Introduction

**Adaptive frameworks** in project management refer to methodologies that allow teams to respond to change quickly and efficiently. These frameworks emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction above strict adherence to a plan. The ultimate goal is to deliver a product that meets the customer's needs in the most efficient way possible. Examples of adaptive frameworks include Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.

## Lean

The Agile Manifesto has its roots in the **Lean** methodology and approach. Lean principles were born on the factory floor of post-World War II Japan and introduced to the automotive industry in the United States in the form of the Toyota Production System. 

Lean is a system for increasing efficiency in production processes by using techniques such as reducing the lead time within a production system and reducing the response times from suppliers and customers. 

**Lean**: A project management framework that originated from the Japanese manufacturing industry. The Lean approach aims to improve efficiency and productivity by eliminating waste in all forms from the production process. It emphasizes delivering value to the customer and continuous improvement. 

**Scrum**: A type of Agile project management framework that is used primarily in software development. Scrum teams work in short iterations, called sprints, and aim to deliver a potentially releasable increment of the product at the end of each sprint. Scrum emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and transparency.

The agile Scrum framework is based on the following ideas:

- The customer is the product owner.
- The scrum master coaches the developers and facilitates development.
- The developers do a substantial amount of planning, execution, and management of the project.

**Kanban**: Another Agile project management framework that visualizes the workflow of a project. In a Kanban system, tasks are represented by cards that move along a board as they progress through different stages of the workflow. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput.

The **Agile Manifesto** serves as the cornerstone for most agile frameworks. It has **four** guiding principles:

We value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

**Lean** is a methodology and approach. The techniques work toward reducing the volume of **work in process (WIP).**

![Untitled](Untitled%2011.png)

Lean is a system for increasing efficiency in production processes by using techniques such as reducing the lead time within a production system and reducing the response times from suppliers and customers. These techniques work toward the ultimate objective, which is reducing the volume of **work in progress (WIP)**. When the WIP volume is reduced, the system is operating more efficiently because previous points where some work had to wait before moving to the next stage have been reduced.

- **Work in Progress (WIP)** refers to the stage in a project where tasks or processes have been initiated but are not yet completed. In the context of Lean methodology and other adaptive frameworks, minimizing WIP is a key strategy as it helps to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and streamline the workflow.

### Eliminating Waste

Eliminating waste is the cornerstone of Lean. When you eliminate waste in a system by optimizing flow, you provide better value to your stakeholders.

What kinds of waste should you stop? Here are some examples:

- Delay, waiting time, and time spent in queues with no value being added
- Production of more than is needed
- Overprocessing
- Non-value-adding activities
- Transportation
- Unnecessary movement or motion
- Inventory
- Defects in a product

### Value Stream Mapping Using the Lean Approach

**Value Stream Mapping**: This is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. It aims to identify and eliminate waste in the process, thereby promoting efficiency and productivity.

1. **Identify value**: You consider the customer perspective when you identify value. It is not the Lean or project team that specifies the value.
2. **Study the value stream**: A value stream is all the actions taken to deliver a product, from the initiation phase through product launch.
3. **Investigate waste in the flow**: It is important to eliminate waste in the flow by removing non-value-adding steps and focusing on essential value-adding or value-enabling steps.
4. **Streamline the process for agility**: It is important to consider customer priorities to optimize delivery.
5. **Perform continuous improvement**: It is important to evaluate the flow and activities constantly.

### Example of Value Stream Mapping in a Software Development Project

1. **Identify value**: The value is defined from the customer's perspective. For a software development project, the customer values a reliable, user-friendly application that meets their specific needs. The project team identifies these needs through customer interviews and market research.
2. **Study the value stream**: The value stream includes all the actions required to deliver the software from concept to delivery. This involves stages such as requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. The team maps out each step in the current process to understand the flow of work.
3. **Investigate waste in the flow**: The team looks for inefficiencies in the current workflow. For example, they might find that there are delays in the handoff between the design and development teams, or that excessive time is spent on manual testing. Identifying these bottlenecks and non-value-adding activities helps in understanding where improvements are needed.
4. **Streamline the process for agility**: To optimize the workflow, the team implements changes such as automating the testing process, improving communication between teams, and adopting agile practices like continuous integration. These changes help in reducing lead times and ensure that the team can respond quickly to changes in customer requirements.
5. **Perform continuous improvement**: The team regularly reviews the workflow to identify new areas for improvement. They hold retrospectives at the end of each sprint to discuss what went well and what could be improved. This ongoing evaluation helps in maintaining an efficient, high-performing process that consistently delivers value to the customer.

**Agile** is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It involves iterative progress through small, manageable increments, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver value continuously. Agile methodologies prioritize individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change over rigid processes and extensive documentation.

### Iteration-Based Agile

In **Iteration-based agile**, a team works in *timeboxes of equal duration* to deliver features. The team works on the most important features first. For each feature, the team goes through the complete stages of analysis, construction, and testing. An example of the framework using this approach is **Scrum.**

It is important that the features being developed be of equal size. Features can be measured by story points, for instance, to determine which features can be accommodated within any given iteration. 

![Untitled](Untitled%2013.png)

### Flow-Based Agile

In **flow-based agile,** a team *pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work*, not on an iteration-based schedule. An example of a framework using this approach is **Kanban.**

- In flow-based agile, the team defines its workflow by using columns on a task board, sets limits for the work in progress for each stage of the workflow, and manages the work in progress for each column to remain within the limits that have been set.

![Untitled](Untitled%2014.png)

### Scrum

By far the most common of the agile approaches is **Scrum.** This framework addresses all 4 values and 12 principles of the agile manifesto. Scrum is a powerful approach because it is simple in structure and addresses the need for effective team collaboration very well. 

Scrum consists of the following components:

- **Roles (accountabilities):** Participants who create project outputs
- **Events:** Various actions to be carried out by the roles
- **Artifacts:** Documents developed by the roles during the execution of a projects

The agile Scrum framework is based on the following ideas:

- The customer is the product owner.
- The scrum master coaches the developers and facilitates development.
- The developers do a substantial amount of planning, execution, and management of the project.

To summarize, we can list the scrum accountabilities, or roles, as follows:

- **Developers** (development team): The developers are the people who create the product. In software development, these are the business analyst, systems analyst, programmer, quality assurance specialist, and anyone else who plays a role in delivering a software system. Typically, this group consists of five to nine members. The best structure for the team is self-organizing and cross-functional. Developers are typically independent minded and decide how to turn the product backlog into increments of helpful functionality in the form of deliverables.
- **Product owner**: The product owner is an active and contributing player throughout, proposing the features to be implemented from the **product backlog** at the start of each sprint, reviewing the functionality at the end of each sprint, and, in between, constantly reviewing the backlog and prioritizing features to provide the most value. The product owner is the key decision maker representing the customer and the business.
- **Scrum master**: The scrum master’s role is to coach, train, and motivate the project team; resolve impediments; and guide the team toward the realization of the goals of each sprint. Therefore, the scrum master role is often considered to be a “true leader” (or, in earlier editions of the Scrum Guide, a “servant leader”).

### Processes and Artifacts

![Untitled](Untitled%2015.png)

**Product Backlog:** This is a list of features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that need to be added to the product during development. It is a dynamic list, which means it constantly changes as the team understands more about the product and the users' needs.

**Sprint Planning:** This is a meeting where the team determines what they will work on during the upcoming sprint. They discuss each item in the product backlog and decide which ones are the highest priority and most feasible to complete in the sprint.

**Sprint Backlog:** This is a list of tasks the team needs to perform in order to deliver the features they committed to during sprint planning. It is a subset of the product backlog.

**Daily Scrum:** This is a short meeting (usually 15 minutes) that happens every day during a sprint. The team discusses what they did the previous day, what they will do today, and any obstacles they are facing.

**Development Work:** This refers to the actual tasks the team performs to develop the product. This could be writing code, doing design work, testing, and more.

**Sprint Review:** This is a meeting at the end of a sprint where the team presents what they completed during the sprint. The product owner and stakeholders provide feedback that could lead to new backlog items.

**Sprint Retrospective:** This is a meeting where the team reflects on the past sprint. They discuss what went well, what didn't, and how they can improve in the next sprint.

**Potentially Shippable Product Increment:** This is the result of a sprint. It is a completed piece of the product that adds value and could be delivered to the customer. The goal of each sprint is to produce a potentially shippable product increment.

[Scrum Process](Scrum%20Process%20e57475398a044daa9aa711bb9354a6cd.md)

### Scrum Core Values

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, also known as empiricism. Sprints use a process that is transparent to all stakeholders, allowing them to inspect and adapt the process.

Scrum core values are the foundation on which the Scrum framework is built.

The **Scrum Core Values** are:

1. **Commitment**: The team is self-organizing, and every member is committed to achieving the team's goals.
2. **Courage**: The team has the courage to face challenges and work on problems to deliver the best possible product.
3. **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
4. **Openness**: The team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges they face.
5. **Respect**: Team members respect each other to be capable, independent individuals.

**Timeboxing** is a critical component of Scrum. We have all participated in meetings that have gone on so long that we’ve wished the session would end. The Scrum framework prescribes time limits for various scrum events, including recommendations for the duration of sprints, daily scrums, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

- Timeboxing is a time management technique where a fixed time period, or "box," is allocated to each activity or task. This method encourages efficiency by limiting the time spent on an activity and helps to focus efforts on the most important tasks. It is a critical component of Scrum and other project management methodologies.

Figure 8-10 shows the recommended guidelines for timeboxing:

![Timeboxing Guidelines for Scrum Events](Untitled%2016.png)

Timeboxing Guidelines for Scrum Events

### Challenges With Scrum

Scrum is the most successful agile framework today, but it does have some disadvantages, including the following:

- **Organizational structure**: The organizational culture, design, and structure in an organization may make it difficult for the organization to adopt and scale Scrum.
- **Unnecessary Work**: Scrum teams may continue to add user stories and features, delivering unnecessary work. Such increases occur when there is a breakdown in communication and collaboration between the scrum team and the product owner.
- **Struggling to transition**: A project will be challenged if the scrum master and product owner are not proficient with the framework. This can often occur when a development team remains entrenched in its familiar predictive approaches.
- **Turnover**: The success of a project depends on the development team staying together across inflexible sprint iterations. If there is turnover, the scrum project is likely to fail because the accumulated knowledge and experience on the team become compromised.

## Kanban

The **Kanban method** and the **Kanban approach** are two distinct concepts. 

- The **kanban approach** is a visual signaling system used to manage and control the flow of materials or information in a production process.
- The **kanban method**, on the other hand, is a development approach developed by David Anderson that uses the kanban approach as a key component. It is a methodical approach to improving workflow efficiency and managing work in progress.

The **Kanban approach** is best suited for the following conditions in an organization:

- **Flexibility**: Teams prefer not to work in precise timeboxes and on a strict release cadence. They want flexibility. Alternatively, the features may differ in size and complexity, and it might not be possible to chunk features into equal lengths.
- **Focus on continuous delivery:** Teams are focused on flowing work through the system to completion. There is a commitment to not begin new work until work in progress is complete.
- **Focus on increased efficiency**: The team checks each task for value-adding or non-value-adding activities and removes the non-value-adding activities.
- **Team member focus**: Limited work in progress allows the team to focus on the current work.
- **Variability in the workload**: Unpredictability in the way that work arrives makes it impossible for teams to make predictable commitments, even for short periods of time.
- **Reduction of waste**: Transparency makes waste visible so it can be removed.

### Limiting WIP

**Work in progress (WIP)** refers to the number of task items a team is working on at a given time.  Limiting WIP is significant because it helps maximize the throughput of work. If the WIP becomes greater than the WIP limit, you must reallocate available resources and remove impediments to reduce WIP.

### Workflow Focus

In the agile framework context, Kanban centers on improving the workflow of a project. It is less prescriptive than the timeboxed approaches Scrum and XP, and there is less focus on meeting milestones or due dates.

Kanban is a framework for advancing continued productivity flow. The main focus is to reduce the WIP for a production process that results in a produced component or product while maintaining high product quality. Kanban is more throughput oriented; that is, it increases efficiency by creating more in the same amount of time. By reducing waste, Kanban achieves process improvements.

The Kanban framework also helps project teams reduce bottlenecks, improve efficiency, increase quality, and boost overall throughput. They achieve this with the help of the **kanban board**, which organizes the workflow in **three** steps: **To do, In progress**, and **Done**. 

- For example, a kanban board could be a whiteboard, a chalkboard, or a software-based board representation. Each deliverable is written on a note, and the note is placed under the proper status. The note is then moved on the project status board as the deliverable moves through the corresponding stages.

![Untitled](Untitled%2017.png)

### Comparing Kanban and Scrum

Kanban and Scrum have different roots and are distinctly different approaches, but both help project teams implement the values and principles of the agile management framework.

### Comparing Kanban and Scrum

### Team Management

- **Kanban**: Emphasizes individual responsibility and self-management. Team members pull tasks based on capacity and manage their own workload.
- **Scrum**: Relies on defined roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. The Scrum Master facilitates the process while the Product Owner manages the backlog.

### Process Improvement

- **Kanban**: Focuses on continuous improvement by visualizing workflow and identifying bottlenecks. Teams continuously make incremental changes to improve efficiency.
- **Scrum**: Implements improvement through regular retrospectives at the end of each sprint, where the team reflects on what went well and what can be improved.

### Productivity Measurement

- **Kanban**: Measures productivity through metrics like cycle time and lead time, focusing on the flow of work.
- **Scrum**: Measures productivity using velocity, which is the number of story points completed in a sprint.

### Life Cycles

- **Kanban**: Does not prescribe specific phases or iterations; it is a continuous flow-based system.
- **Scrum**: Follows iterative cycles called sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks, with defined start and end points.

### Time Focus

- **Kanban**: Time is not fixed; tasks are pulled based on capacity and completed as soon as possible.
- **Scrum**: Timeboxed into sprints, with each sprint having a fixed duration and defined goals for what will be accomplished.

### Commonalities

- Both emphasize visual management and transparency.
- Both focus on delivering value to the customer and improving workflow efficiency.
- Both are flexible and can be adapted to different types of projects beyond software development.

### Extreme Programming

**Extreme Programming (XP)** is an iterative-incremental framework that is popular for software development and that shares many features with Scrum.

For instance, it is a timeboxed framework that involved actual customers, co-located teams, and practices such as user stories and standups.

### What Can We Learn from XP?

![Untitled](Untitled%2018.png)

**Pair programming**: Four eyes are better than two! A creative effort such as writing code has historically been a largely solitary creative effort. However, productivity is increased, and defects are reduced when two developers work on a task.

**Refactoring**: It is important not to break or disrupt service to the customer when working on a new product. It is also important not start from scratch; instead, reuse and reorganize existing code, remove duplicate code, and increase cohesion.

**Continuous integration**: It is important to bring together and integrate completed work. Early integration brings faulty design or functionality to the surface and prevents wasted time and effort.

**Collective code ownership**: Collective ownership means that every developer can improve or amend any code. Collective ownership results in increased visibility and wider dissemination of product knowledge for the entire team. This promotes continuous knowledge sharing, efficient peer reviews, and fewer defects.

### Feature-Driven Development

Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is a software development framework organized around implementing features in large and lengthy projects. FDD supports agile best practices.

The goal in FDD is to deliver client-valued functionality, or “features first.” This requires developing a prioritized features list, designing features, and then building each feature.

FDD is like Scrum but uses shorter iterations. Features are delivered in as little as 2 days. No lengthy iteration cycles are involved. Also, whereas Scrum involves user stories to capture and communicate requirements, FDD uses features. Finally, the end user is the target customer for the development process, whereas in Scrum, the product owner is the target customer.

FDD projects are designed to follow a five-step development process, built largely around discrete features:

- Develop an overall model.
- Build a features list.
- Plan by feature.
- Design by feature.
- Build by feature.

![Untitled](Untitled%2019.png)

### Dynamic Systems Development Method

**Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**: The Dynamic Systems Development Method is an Agile project delivery framework that has its roots primarily in the software development industry. It follows an iterative and incremental approach to development, which places a strong emphasis on continuous user involvement from the beginning to the end of the project. This methodology is built on the belief that no product is built perfectly in the first attempt and treats software development as an exploratory process where changes and improvements are part of the journey towards an effective system. DSDM incorporates periodic reviews and adjustments of the project scope and direction to ensure alignment with evolving business needs. Key aspects of DSDM include prioritizing requirements based on business value, delivering frequent, usable increments of the software, and fostering a collaborative and cooperative approach to work.

### Crystal

**Crystal**: Crystal is a family of Agile methodologies for software development, conceived and developed by Alistair Cockburn. The Crystal family focuses on several key areas: people, their interactions, the community around the project, skills, talents, and communications. Crystal methods are categorized by colors, which represent the "weight" or complexity of the project, with lighter colors (such as Crystal Clear) suited for smaller projects and darker colors (like Crystal Sapphire) for larger, more complex projects. Unlike other methodologies that propose a one-size-fits-all solution, Crystal is highly adaptable and encourages teams to tailor the methodology to fit the unique needs of individual teams and projects. The name 'Crystal' comes from the idea that each project has its own unique shape, set of attributes, and requirements, thus forming a unique 'crystal'.

### Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a set of organizational and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling lean and agile practices. It provides a structured approach for large-scale software development that incorporates principles from lean manufacturing, systems thinking, and agile development. SAFe is designed to help organizations deliver high-quality products and services faster and more predictably.

Key components of SAFe include:

1. **Team Level**: Focuses on agile teams using Scrum, Kanban, or other agile methodologies to deliver small increments of value.
2. **Program Level**: Organizes multiple agile teams into an Agile Release Train (ART) that delivers larger, integrated solutions.
3. **Large Solution Level**: Addresses the needs of enterprises building large and complex solutions that require the coordination of multiple ARTs.
4. **Portfolio Level**: Aligns strategy and execution by applying lean portfolio management principles, including funding and governance, to support agile programs and teams.

SAFe emphasizes continuous delivery, DevOps, and a culture of relentless improvement. It provides a framework for aligning teams, ensuring transparency, and fostering collaboration across the organization.

# A WBS Makes a Project Manageable

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a project management tool that breaks down a project into smaller, more manageable components. It helps organize the team's work into manageable sections by defining and grouping a project's discrete work elements in a way that helps organize and define the total work scope of the project. The WBS provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a project.

A WBS can be set up in either graphical form or outline form. Either way, they list the various tasks involved. For example, designing and putting in a new lawn with a sprinkler system, surrounded by a new fence, involves a number of different tasks. The graphic WBS paints a picture that makes it easy to understand all the parts of a project, but the outlined WBS is more practical because you can list hundreds of tasks on it—far more than can be listed using the graphic approach.

The WBS clarifies and provides necessary details for a number of project management activities. Building a WBS helps to:

- **Provide a detailed illustration of project scope.** Though the charter defines scope at the conceptual level, a comprehensive look at a project's scope can be accomplished only with a WBS.
- **Monitor progress.** The tasks on the WBS become the basis for monitoring progress, because each is a measurable unit of work.
- **Create accurate cost and schedule estimates.** The WBS will detail costs for equipment, labor, and materials on each task.
- **Build project teams.** Every team member wants clear work assignments and a sense of how their work fits into the overall effort. A good WBS does both. You can also increase the team's commitment to the plan by having them participate in building the WBS.

The WBS breaks all the work in the project into separate tasks (tasks may also be referred to as *activities*). There are two kinds of tasks on a WBS: **summary tasks** and **work packages**.

**Summary tasks** are higher-level tasks that encompass a group of related work packages or subtasks. They provide an overview of a larger portion of the project, making it easier to manage and organize the work.

**Work packages** are the lowest level of tasks in a WBS and represent a single, well-defined piece of work. These are the tasks that can be assigned to team members and tracked for progress, costs, and completion.

![Untitled](Untitled%2032.png)

Note that a **summary tasks** is not actually executed; rather, it *summarizes* the subordinate work packages. The **work packages** are the tasks that are actually executed. 

## WBS on an Agile Project

While traditional projects often rely on a detailed WBS to map out all tasks in advance, Agile projects take a more iterative approach. In Agile methodologies, the WBS can still be a useful tool, but it's typically more flexible and adaptive to change. Agile projects focus on breaking down the work into manageable sprints or iterations, each with its own set of user stories or tasks.

In an Agile project, the WBS might be represented by the product backlog and sprint backlogs. Each user story or task in the backlog can be thought of as a work package, which is a smaller, manageable piece of work that contributes to the overall project goals. The summary tasks in an Agile WBS could correspond to larger project themes or epics, which group related user stories together.

The iterative nature of Agile allows teams to frequently reassess and re-prioritize tasks, ensuring that the most valuable work is completed first. This flexibility makes it easier to adapt to changing requirements and deliver incremental value to stakeholders.

Using a WBS in an Agile project provides the following benefits:

- **Clarifies project scope and goals:** Just like in traditional projects, a WBS in Agile helps ensure everyone understands the overall project scope and objectives.
- **Facilitates sprint planning:** Breaking down the work into smaller tasks makes it easier to plan and execute sprints.
- **Tracks progress:** The WBS allows the team to monitor progress against the defined tasks and adjust as needed.
- **Enhances collaboration:** By involving the team in creating and updating the WBS, you foster a sense of ownership and collaboration.

In summary, while the WBS in Agile projects may not be as rigid or detailed as in traditional projects, it still serves as a valuable tool for organizing work, tracking progress, and ensuring alignment with project goals.

### Steps to Create a WBS

1. **Define the Project Scope and Objectives:** Start by understanding the project's overall scope and objectives. This includes identifying the main deliverables and the project's end goals. Clear scope definition helps ensure that the WBS covers all necessary aspects of the project.
2. **Break Down the Project into Major Deliverables:** Divide the project into major deliverables or components. These high-level deliverables are the first level of the WBS and serve as the summary tasks. Each deliverable should represent a significant portion of the project.
3. **Decompose Deliverables into Work Packages:** Further break down each major deliverable into smaller, manageable work packages. These work packages represent the lowest level of the WBS and should be specific tasks that can be assigned, tracked, and completed. Ensure that each work package has a clear scope, budget, and timeline.

### Criteria for a Successful WBS

- **Completeness:** The WBS should cover the entire scope of the project, ensuring that no essential tasks or deliverables are left out.
- **Clarity:** Each task and deliverable should be clearly defined and understandable to all team members and stakeholders.
- **Measurability:** Tasks should be defined in a way that allows for easy measurement of progress and performance.
- **Assignability:** Each work package should be specific enough to be assigned to a team member or group.
- **Manageability:** Tasks should be broken down into manageable chunks that can be realistically completed within a given timeframe and budget.
- **Non-Redundancy:** Each task or work package should be unique, with no overlap or duplication of effort.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** The WBS should follow a logical hierarchical structure, with higher-level summary tasks encompassing related lower-level work packages.
- **Consistency:** The level of detail should be consistent across all parts of the WBS to ensure uniformity and coherence.
- **Traceability:** Each work package should be traceable back to the project's overall objectives and deliverables.
- **Flexibility:** The WBS should be adaptable to changes in project scope or requirements, especially in Agile projects.
- **Stakeholder Agreement:** All stakeholders should agree on the WBS structure and content to ensure alignment and buy-in.
- **Documentation:** The WBS should be well-documented, with clear descriptions of each task, deliverable, and the criteria for completion.

### Size of Work Packages

The size of work packages can vary depending on the project's complexity and the team's preference, but there are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Manageable Size:** Each work package should be small enough to be easily managed and completed within a reasonable timeframe, typically within one to two reporting periods.
2. **Measurable:** Work packages should be defined in such a way that progress can be easily tracked and measured.
3. **Assignable:** Each work package should be specific enough to be assigned to a single person or a small team.
4. **Estimable:** The scope, effort, and resources required to complete the work package should be estimable.
5. **Deliverable-Oriented:** Work packages should focus on producing a specific deliverable or outcome, rather than just completing a set of activities.

While there are no strict rules for the exact size of work packages, adhering to these guidelines will help ensure that they are practical and effective for project management.

### Completion Criteria for Work Packages

To ensure that work packages are completed effectively, it is important to define clear completion criteria. These criteria help determine when a work package is considered finished and can include the following elements:

1. **Deliverable Produced:** The work package should result in a specific deliverable that meets the project's requirements and quality standards.
2. **Acceptance Criteria Met:** The deliverable must meet predefined acceptance criteria, which are agreed upon by stakeholders and the project team.
3. **Quality Standards Achieved:** The work should adhere to the quality standards and guidelines set for the project.
4. **Documentation Complete:** Any necessary documentation, such as reports, user manuals, or design documents, should be completed and approved.
5. **Reviews and Approvals Obtained:** All required reviews and approvals from stakeholders, team members, or quality assurance personnel should be obtained.
6. **Testing Completed:** If applicable, the deliverable should undergo testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing) to ensure it functions as intended.
7. **Dependencies Resolved:** Any dependencies or prerequisites for the work package should be addressed and resolved.
8. **Budget and Time Constraints Met:** The work package should be completed within the allocated budget and timeframe.
9. **Stakeholder Sign-Off:** Key stakeholders should review and sign off on the completed work package to confirm their satisfaction with the results.
10. **Integration into Larger Project:** The deliverable should be integrated into the larger project or system, ensuring it fits seamlessly with other components.

By defining and meeting these completion criteria, project teams can ensure that work packages are completed to a high standard and contribute effectively to the overall success of the project.

# Understanding the Problem

---

Project managers should learn about problem-solving because it equips them with the skills needed to identify, analyze, and resolve issues that can arise during a project. Effective problem-solving helps to ensure that projects stay on track, meet deadlines, and achieve their objectives. It also enhances a project manager's ability to make informed decisions, improve team collaboration, and manage resources efficiently. Ultimately, strong problem-solving abilities contribute to the overall success and quality of the project.

### **Problem-solving** 
Problem solving is the process of identifying a problem, determining its cause, selecting alternatives for a solution, and implementing the solution. This process involves a series of steps that include understanding the problem, generating potential solutions, evaluating and selecting the best solution, and then implementing and monitoring the chosen solution. Effective problem-solving requires critical thinking, creativity, and a systematic approach to ensure that the problem is resolved efficiently and effectively.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of problem-solving, we must first delve into what is meant by a problem.

### A **problem** is a deviation between an actual situation and a desired situation.

- Essentially, it is an obstacle, impediment, difficulty, or challenge that invites resolution; the resolution of which is recognized as a solution or contribution toward a known purpose or goal.
- The problem can be to **add** something that is currently absent, to **remove** something that is potentially negative, or to **correct** something that is not performing as expected.
    - Therefore, problems can be formulated in a **positive** or **negative** manner. Problems are formulated in a **positive** manner if ****the objective is to determine how to take advantage of an opportunity, whereas a **negative** formulation focuses on addressing a deficiency or issue.

Some *problems* must be resolved immediately, whereas other problems may be able to be delayed and then resolved sometime in the future. Some problems are considered “good” problems because the objective is to take advantage of an opportunity.

The time it takes to resolve a problem is often a measure of its **complexity**.

- Spending **too little** time on problem definition can result in poor formulation of the problem, create confusion, and most likely lengthen the time needed to make effective decisions.
- Conversely, spending **too much** time on problem definition can lead to unnecessary delays in the time needed for effective decision-making and implementation of a solution.

Adding more people to the problem-solving session cannot always reduce the time it takes to resolve the issue. In some cases, we end up creating additional problems for ourselves. Effective problem-solving often requires a balanced approach that considers the input of all relevant stakeholders without overwhelming the process with too many perspectives.

Problems imply that some alternatives exist. Problems that have *no alternatives* are called **open problems.** Not all problems can be solved or should be solved. For example, in research and development (R&D) and new product development, it may take as many as 50-60 ideas to generate one commercially viable new product. **The cost could be prohibitive to evaluate these many alternatives.**

### Techniques
There are several techniques that can be used to identify problems. These include:

1. **Brainstorming**: This technique involves gathering a group of people and having them freely suggest a wide range of ideas and possible causes of the problem. The key here is to encourage open thinking and free flow of ideas without immediate criticism or judgment.
    - *Example*: A team of software developers brainstorms issues causing a recent increase in software crashes. They suggest various potential causes such as recent code changes, hardware issues, and user behavior patterns.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: This technique is used to identify the underlying cause of a problem, rather than just addressing the symptoms. By identifying the root cause, you can prevent the problem from recurring, leading to a more sustainable solution.
    - *Example*: In a manufacturing plant, frequent machine breakdowns are analyzed using root cause analysis. The team identifies that the breakdowns are due to poor maintenance schedules rather than the age of the machines.
3. **The 5 Whys Technique**: This technique involves asking "why" five times to drill down into the problem's cause and effect relationships. It helps to identify the fundamental cause of a problem.
    - *Example*: A retail store experiences a sudden drop in sales. By asking "why" five times, they discover the root cause is a recent change in store layout that has confused customers.
4. **SWOT Analysis**: This technique involves identifying Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to the problem. It provides a comprehensive view of the internal and external factors affecting the problem.
    - *Example*: A startup conducts a SWOT analysis to understand why their product launch was unsuccessful. They identify strengths like innovative features, weaknesses like poor marketing, opportunities in untapped markets, and threats from established competitors.
5. **Pareto Analysis**: This technique involves identifying the most significant factors contributing to the problem. It is based on the Pareto Principle, which states that 80% of the problems are often caused by 20% of the factors.
    - *Example*: A customer service department uses Pareto analysis to find that the majority of customer complaints stem from just a few recurring issues like delayed deliveries and billing errors.
6. **Templates or Checklists**: This technique involves using a series of questions or a checklist to systematically identify present or future problems. It ensures that all potential issues are considered and addressed.
    - *Example*: A project manager uses a checklist to review all potential risks before starting a new construction project, ensuring that issues like safety protocols, resource availability, and environmental impact are all considered.

---

### Sensemaking
Sensemaking is important in the problem-solving process because it helps individuals and organizations interpret and understand complex or unfamiliar situations. By collecting data, recognizing patterns, and forming explanations, sensemaking guides decision-making processes and ensures that actions are based on a comprehensive understanding of the problem. This method enables proactive planning, improves the accuracy of problem identification, and helps in developing effective solutions. Ultimately, sensemaking enhances the ability to navigate uncertainty, learn from past experiences, and anticipate future challenges or opportunities.

**Sensemaking** is a process through which individuals or organizations interpret and create an understanding of unfamiliar or complex situations. It involves collecting data, recognizing patterns, forming explanations, and deciding the best course of action. This method is often used in problem-solving to make sense of complex problems and to guide decision-making processes.

**Retrospective Sensemaking** refers to the process of making sense of past events or situations. It involves analyzing and interpreting past experiences, data, and patterns to understand what happened and why it happened. This type of sensemaking can help us learn from past mistakes, successes, and experiences, thereby improving future decision-making and problem-solving. By examining what has already occurred, we can uncover valuable insights and lessons that can inform our actions moving forward. Retrospective sensemaking often requires a detailed examination of events and their contexts, allowing us to see the broader picture and make more informed judgments about past actions and their outcomes.

**Prospective Sensemaking**, on the other hand, involves making sense of future scenarios or situations. It is about anticipating potential problems or opportunities and planning accordingly. This type of sensemaking can help us prepare for the future and make informed decisions by considering various possible outcomes and their implications. By engaging in prospective sensemaking, we can envision different scenarios and develop strategies to address them effectively. This forward-thinking approach allows us to be proactive rather than reactive, equipping us with the foresight needed to navigate uncertainty and seize opportunities as they arise. Prospective sensemaking encourages us to think creatively and strategically about the future, ensuring that we are ready to face whatever comes our way.

### Leadership
The leadership style that the project manager selects determines whether retrospective or prospective sensemaking will be emphasized as well as the approach to reformulating the project if necessary. The outcome of sensemaking can be a reformulation of the original problem or the development of new plans that focus on somewhat different outcomes.

For instance, a project manager who adopts a **transformational leadership style** is likely to emphasize prospective sensemaking. This style encourages forward-thinking, innovation, and envisioning future possibilities. Transformational leaders inspire their teams to anticipate future challenges and opportunities, and to develop creative solutions and strategies to address them. They often engage in strategic planning sessions that focus on potential scenarios and their implications, fostering a proactive approach to problem-solving.

On the other hand, a project manager with a **transactional leadership style** might lean more towards retrospective sensemaking. This style emphasizes maintaining established processes and achieving specific goals through clear instructions and performance monitoring. Transactional leaders often focus on analyzing past performance data and experiences to understand what has worked well and what hasn't. They use this information to make informed decisions about current projects, ensuring that past lessons are applied to improve future outcomes.

**Reformulation** of the project may be necessary if the initial understanding of the problem was incomplete or inaccurate. For example, if the team initially based their decisions on assumptions rather than concrete data, they might need to revisit and revise their approach once more accurate information becomes available. Similarly, significant changes in the enterprise environmental factors, such as market conditions, regulatory requirements, or technological advancements, may necessitate a re-evaluation of the project's objectives and strategies.

The knowledge gained from sensemaking can lead to several possible outcomes:

1. **Reaffirmation of Original Expectations**: Sensemaking might reveal that the original project expectations are still valid, but the approach to achieving them needs adjustment. In this case, the project is reformulated to better align with the validated expectations, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively.
2. **Modification of Expectations**: If sensemaking indicates that the original expectations are no longer feasible or relevant, the project manager and team may need to establish new goals and outcomes. This could involve shifting the project's focus, reallocating resources, or redefining success criteria to align with the updated understanding.
3. **Development of New Plans**: Based on the insights gained from sensemaking, new strategies and action plans can be developed. These plans may focus on different outcomes than initially anticipated, reflecting a more accurate understanding of the problem and its context.

In summary, the project manager's leadership style plays a crucial role in shaping the sensemaking process and its outcomes. Whether emphasizing retrospective or prospective sensemaking, effective leadership ensures that the project remains adaptable and responsive to evolving conditions, thereby enhancing its chances of success.

**Reformulation** may be necessary if the team did not fully understand the way that the problem was initially presented to them, decision-making was being made based upon guesses rather than facts, or if significant changes occurred in the enterprise environmental factors.

- The knowledge gained from sensemaking may indicate that the original expectations are still valid, but that the project must be reformulated to better align with those expectations. If the original expectations are no longer valid, then a new trajectory with perhaps modified expectations may be necessary. This ongoing process of sensemaking and reformulation ensures that the project remains relevant and responsive to changing conditions and new information.
In summary, both problem-solving and sensemaking are critical processes that require thoughtful consideration, effective communication, and strategic planning. By understanding and applying these processes, individuals and organizations can navigate complex challenges, seize opportunities, and achieve their goals more effectively.

# Data Gathering

Data gathering in project management involves collecting relevant information from various sources to help in decision-making, planning, and execution of a project. This process can include methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, and reviewing existing records or data sets. Effective data gathering ensures that project managers have the necessary information to analyze project progress, identify risks, and make informed decisions.

## Reasons for Data Gathering

1. Informed Decision-Making: Collecting data allows project managers to make well-informed decisions based on accurate and relevant information.
2. Risk Identification: Data helps in identifying potential risks and issues early in the project lifecycle.
3. Progress Tracking: Regular data gathering enables the monitoring of project progress and performance.
4. Resource Allocation: Data helps in efficiently allocating resources where they are most needed.
5. Stakeholder Communication: Provides a factual basis for communicating with stakeholders and justifying project decisions.
6. Continuous Improvement: Facilitates ongoing evaluation and improvement of project processes and outcomes.

## Data-Gathering Techniques

1. Root Cause Analysis: This technique involves identifying the underlying causes of issues or problems within a project. By pinpointing the root causes, project managers can develop strategies to address and mitigate these issues effectively.
2. Panels of Experts: A panel of experts consists of individuals with specialized knowledge and experience. Gathering insights and opinions from these experts can provide valuable information and perspectives that can inform project decisions and strategies.
3. Facilitated Work Groups: These are structured group sessions led by a facilitator, where team members collaboratively discuss and analyze various aspects of the project. This method encourages diverse viewpoints and can help generate innovative solutions.
4. Questionnaires: A questionnaire is a set of pre-designed questions used to gather information from respondents. This technique is useful for collecting quantitative data and can be distributed to a large audience to gain broad insights.
5. Surveys: Similar to questionnaires, surveys are used to collect data from a targeted group of respondents. Surveys can include a mix of closed and open-ended questions, allowing for both quantitative and qualitative data collection.
6. Interviews: Interviews involve direct, face-to-face or virtual conversations with stakeholders, team members, or subject matter experts. This technique allows for in-depth qualitative data collection and can provide detailed insights into specific issues or topics.
7. Observations and Measurements: This technique involves systematically observing and recording behaviors, activities, or processes within the project. Measurements can include quantitative data such as time, quantity, or quality metrics, providing an objective basis for analysis.
8. Use of Prototypes: Prototyping involves creating a preliminary model or version of a project deliverable. This technique allows stakeholders to interact with the prototype, providing feedback that can be used to refine and improve the final product.
9. Diagramming Techniques such as Cause and Effect Diagrams: Diagramming techniques like cause-and-effect diagrams (also known as fishbone diagrams) help visualize the relationships between different factors and their potential impacts on the project. This method aids in identifying and analyzing complex issues.
10. Critical Reviews of Performance Data: This technique involves systematically reviewing and analyzing performance data from the project. By examining key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics, project managers can assess progress, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
11. Case Study Analysis: Case study analysis involves examining previous projects or similar scenarios to identify lessons learned and best practices. This technique can provide valuable insights and help inform current project strategies and decision-making processes.

## Metrics and Early Warning Indicators

Metrics and early warning indicators are essential tools in project management for monitoring and assessing the health of a project. Metrics provide quantifiable measures of various project aspects, while early warning indicators help identify potential issues before they escalate into significant problems.

1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): KPIs are specific, measurable metrics that track the performance and progress of a project. Common KPIs include schedule variance, cost variance, and resource utilization. Monitoring these indicators helps project managers gauge whether the project is on track to meet its objectives.
2. Earned Value Management (EVM): EVM is a technique that integrates scope, schedule, and cost data to assess project performance and progress. Key EVM metrics include Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), and Actual Cost (AC). These metrics help project managers determine if the project is progressing as planned and within budget.
3. Milestone Achievement: Tracking the completion of key project milestones provides an early indication of project progress. Delays in achieving milestones can signal potential issues that need to be addressed promptly.
4. Resource Utilization: Monitoring the allocation and usage of resources, such as personnel, equipment, and materials, helps ensure that resources are being used efficiently. High or low resource utilization can indicate potential bottlenecks or underutilization that may impact project performance.
5. Risk Indicators: Identifying and monitoring risk indicators, such as the number of open risks or the severity of identified risks, helps project managers proactively manage potential threats to the project. Early detection of risks allows for timely mitigation actions.
6. Quality Metrics: Quality metrics, such as defect rates, customer satisfaction scores, and compliance with standards, provide insights into the quality of project deliverables. High defect rates or low satisfaction scores can indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed to ensure project success.
7. Burn Rate: The burn rate measures the rate at which project funds are being spent. Monitoring the burn rate helps project managers assess whether the project is staying within budget and identify potential cost overruns early.
8. Stakeholder Feedback: Regularly gathering feedback from stakeholders, including clients, team members, and sponsors, provides valuable insights into project performance and stakeholder satisfaction. Negative feedback or concerns raised by stakeholders can serve as early warning indicators of potential issues.

By using these metrics and early warning indicators, project managers can maintain better control over the project, make informed decisions, and take corrective actions to ensure successful project outcomes.

## Questions to Ensure Effective Data Gathering

1. What specific information do we need to collect to achieve our project goals?
2. Who are the key stakeholders and subject matter experts we should consult?
3. What are the most reliable sources of data for our project?
4. Which data-gathering techniques are most suitable for our project needs?
5. How can we ensure the accuracy and validity of the data collected?

# Decision-Making Concepts

---

Today, project teams are faced with difficult-to-solve problems that are based upon increasing levels of complexity. Over the years, sponsors and governance committees provided project teams with a great deal of authority to make their own decisions without senior management's involvement. As the paperwork and information requirements for decision-making increased, senior management was reluctant to spend a great deal of time reading through the documentation and evaluating the information for most project decisions as it was taking time away from their other responsibilities.

Project teams today have several approaches available to them for problem solving and decision-making. Some of the new techniques come from management science and operations research models. Other techniques can be more formal models, methods, and procedures that are part of project management methodologies and frameworks.

### Decision-Making Characteristics

Decision-making involves the following: 

- Objectives must first be established
- Objectives must be classified and placed in order of importance
- Alternative actions must be developed
- The alternatives must be evaluated against all the objectives
- The alternative that can achieve all the objectives is the tentative decision
- The tentative decision is evaluated for more possible consequences
- The decisive actions are taken, and additional actions are taken to prevent any adverse consequences from becoming problems and starting both systems (problem analysis and decision-making) all over again.

The **decision-making activities** are often more time-consuming and costlier to perform than the problem-solving activities. This is largely due to the number of alternatives that can be identified, and the methods used to evaluate and prioritize them. Having a significant number of reasonable alternatives may seem nice but being unable to arrive at a decision on which one to actually adopt can be troublesome.

## Decision-Making Participation

There are likewise several reasons why the project manager would want participation by others. Examples might include the project manager's lack of knowledge of all the alternatives, expectations, and desires of team members to participate in decision-making, and the expectation that team member participation will serve as a motivational force for successful execution of a solution.

### Understanding How Decisions Are Made

People must understand prior to attending both the problem-solving and the decision-making meetings how the decisions will be made. There are several options available, and the approach taken to agree on the problem can be different from the decision on which alternative will be adopted. Options include:

- **Majority or consensus**: all participants in the meeting are allowed to vote. The criteria might be a simple majority or another number such as a 75% majority.
- **Qualified majority or consensus**: if a majority is not reached, then the project manager, the client, or another designated individual will make the final decision.
- **Project manager directed**: the project manager makes the decision and informs the team which alternative he/she selected. This approach is most effective on crisis projects.
- **Executive directed**: the executives or project sponsors make the decision based upon the success metrics that they believe track the project's success criteria. If the definition of success changes over the course of the project, this could create a problem.
- **Client directed**: the team identifies the alternatives, make a recommendation, and presents the data to the client. The client then makes the final decision and informs the team. The client may have the right not to select from the team's alternatives but to develop their own solution to the problem.

## Types of Decision-Making in Project Management

- **Routine Decision Making**: This type of decision-making involves handling tasks that are repetitive and can be managed using established processes and procedures. For example, approving regular expense reports or scheduling routine maintenance tasks. The primary benefit of routine decision-making is that it allows project teams to efficiently manage recurring activities without needing to invest significant time or resources.
    - **Example**: Approving monthly expense reports submitted by team members.
- **Adaptive Decision Making**: Adaptive decision-making is used when minor changes or adjustments are necessary in current processes or procedures. For instance, a project team may need to adjust their approach to resource allocation based on unexpected changes in project scope or deadlines. This type of decision-making requires flexibility and the ability to make incremental improvements to existing plans, ensuring the project can adapt to new challenges or opportunities as they arise.
    - **Example**: Adjusting the project timeline to accommodate a new client request that changes the project scope.
- **Innovative Decision Making**: Innovative decision-making involves creating new solutions for problems that have no precedent. It requires creativity and out-of-the-box thinking to develop unique approaches to complex issues. An example might be developing a new technology or methodology to overcome a significant project hurdle. This type of decision-making often involves brainstorming sessions, prototyping, and experimentation to find the best possible solution. The goal is to generate novel ideas that can drive project success in uncharted territories.
    - **Example**: Developing a new software tool to automate a previously manual process, significantly reducing time and errors.
- **Pressured Decision Making**: Decisions made under time constraints or high-stress situations fall into the category of pressured decision-making. These decisions often require quick thinking and the ability to act without having all the necessary information. For instance, a project manager might need to make a rapid decision to address an unexpected crisis, such as a critical system failure. In such scenarios, the decision-maker must rely on their experience, intuition, and available data to make the best possible choice under pressure.
    - **Example**: Deciding to switch to a backup server immediately after a system crash to minimize downtime.
- **Judgmental Decision Making**: Judgmental decision-making relies heavily on the intuition, experience, and judgment of the decision-maker. It often involves subjective evaluation rather than purely objective analysis. For example, a project manager might need to decide which vendor to select based on their past experiences and gut feelings about the vendors' reliability and performance. This type of decision-making is particularly useful when there is a lack of concrete data, and the decision-maker must rely on their expertise and instincts.
    - **Example**: Choosing a vendor for a critical project component based on previous successful collaborations and trust.
- **Rational Decision Making**: Rational decision-making involves a systematic, step-by-step process of defining problems, gathering information, generating alternatives, and choosing the best possible solution based on logical reasoning and factual data. This approach is methodical and aims to minimize biases and errors. For instance, a project team might use a decision matrix to evaluate different software solutions based on various criteria such as cost, functionality, and user-friendliness. Rational decision-making ensures that decisions are made based on comprehensive analysis and objective evidence.
    - **Example**: Using a decision matrix to select the best project management software by evaluating factors such as cost, features, and user reviews.
- **Certainty/Uncertainty Decision Making**: Decisions made under certainty involve scenarios where all necessary information is available, and the outcomes are predictable. For example, deciding to proceed with a well-defined project plan with clear requirements and known risks. Uncertainty decision-making, on the other hand, deals with incomplete information and unpredictable outcomes. This requires risk assessment and management. For instance, launching a new product in an untested market requires making decisions based on assumptions and estimates, with a strategy to mitigate potential risks.
    - **Example under certainty**: Proceeding with a project to upgrade office computers when the budget and requirements are well-defined and stable.
    - **Example under uncertainty**: Deciding to enter a new international market with limited data on local consumer preferences and potential regulatory challenges.
- **Controllable/Noncontrollable Decision Making**: Controllable decisions are those where the project team has influence or control over the variables involved. For example, deciding on the project schedule or resource allocation. Noncontrollable decisions involve external factors that the project team cannot influence, such as regulatory changes or economic downturns. In such cases, the project team must develop strategies to mitigate potential impacts, such as creating contingency plans or adjusting project objectives.
    - **Example of controllable decision**: Allocating additional resources to a critical project phase to ensure timely completion.
    - **Example of noncontrollable decision**: Adjusting project timelines and deliverables in response to new government regulations that affect project scope.
- **Programmed/Nonprogrammed Decision Making**: Programmed decisions are routine and follow established guidelines or policies. These decisions are typically straightforward and can be made quickly, such as approving standard purchase orders. Nonprogrammed decisions are unique and complex, requiring tailored solutions and often involving higher-level strategic thinking. For example, deciding to pivot the project's direction based on emerging market trends requires a thorough analysis and creative problem-solving. Nonprogrammed decision-making is essential for addressing novel challenges that do not have predefined solutions.
    - **Example of programmed decision**: Approving a standard purchase order for office supplies.
    - **Example of nonprogrammed decision**: Deciding to change the project's target market based on new competitor strategies and market research findings.
    
    **Example**: Approving monthly expense reports submitted by team members.
    

### Decision-Making Stages

There are several models available for how project teams make decisions. A typical four phase model might include:

- **Familiarization stage**: this is where the team meets to understand the problem and the decision(s) that must be made.
- **Options identification phase**: this is where the team performs brainstorming and lists possible alternatives for a solution.
- **Option selection phase**: this is where the team decides upon the best option. The team selecting the preferred option may have a different makeup than the team developing the list of options.
- **Justification phase**: this is where the team rationalizes that they made the right decision and possibly evaluates the results.

### Decision-Making Steps

When a project team is faced with a difficult decision, there are several steps one can take to ensure the best possible solution will be found. The decision process begins and ends with the use of information and judgment in removing the uncertainty of future actions. Decisions do not deal with the past; they deal with the present and the future. A decision-maker needs to be creative and skillful and to operate from an experience base in using information in arriving at decisions.

There are several models that can be used. Many of the steps are similar to the steps used in setting up the problem-solving process. Steps that are common to many of these models include:

- Determine the framework of the problem or opportunity that requires a decision
- Send out an agenda identifying the purpose of the decision-making meeting and the expected outcome, including the expected timing for the decision
- Ask the team to come to the meeting with alternative solutions, if possible
- Perform a root cause analysis of the problem to make sure everyone understands why a decision is necessary, and the impact if a decision is not made
- Collect the appropriate facts and assumptions bearing on the decision
- Analyze the facts and assumptions that impact the problem or opportunity
- Develop alternatives that are viable in dealing with the decision
- Analyze the alternatives based on an assessment of the strengths (benefits) and weaknesses (costs) relative to existing organizational purposes (mission, objectives, goals, and strategies)
- Select the alternative that has the best fit with organizational purposes
- Delineate a plan of action on how the decision will be implemented

### Conflicts in Decision-Making

Conflicts in decision-making are inevitable in project management due to the diverse perspectives, interests, and priorities of team members and stakeholders. These conflicts can arise from various sources, including differences in values, goals, information, and power dynamics. Recognizing and addressing these conflicts is crucial for effective decision-making and project success. Some common types of conflicts in decision-making include:

- **Goal Conflicts**: When team members have different objectives or priorities, it can lead to disagreements about the best course of action. For example, one team member may prioritize cost savings, while another may prioritize quality or speed.
- **Information Conflicts**: Disparities in the information available to different team members can lead to conflicting opinions on the best decision. Ensuring that all relevant information is shared transparently can help mitigate this type of conflict.
- **Methodological Conflicts**: Team members may have different approaches or methodologies for solving problems and making decisions. These differences can lead to disagreements about the best process to follow.
- **Interpersonal Conflicts**: Personal differences and interpersonal dynamics can lead to conflicts in decision-making. This can include differences in communication styles, personalities, or levels of experience.
- **Resource Conflicts**: Limited resources, such as time, budget, or personnel, can lead to conflicts when team members have competing demands for these resources.
- **Power Conflicts**: Differences in authority or power within the team can lead to conflicts, especially if some members feel their opinions are not being considered or valued.

To manage and resolve conflicts in decision-making, project managers can use several strategies:

- **Open Communication**: Encourage open and honest communication among team members to ensure that all perspectives are heard and considered.
- **Active Listening**: Practice active listening to understand the underlying concerns and motivations of team members.
- **Facilitation**: Use facilitation techniques to guide discussions and ensure that conflicts are addressed constructively.
- **Consensus Building**: Strive to build consensus by finding common ground and aligning team members' goals and interests.
- **Mediation**: If conflicts escalate, a neutral mediator can help facilitate resolution by addressing the underlying issues and finding mutually acceptable solutions.
- **Decision-Making Frameworks**: Implement structured decision-making frameworks to provide a clear process for evaluating alternatives and making decisions.
- **Conflict Resolution Training**: Provide training for team members on conflict resolution techniques to equip them with the skills to handle disagreements effectively.

By proactively addressing conflicts and fostering a collaborative decision-making environment, project teams can enhance their ability to make informed and effective decisions that support project success.

## Decision Making Styles

### Rational versus Intuitive Thinking

**Rational Thinking**: Rational thinking is a logical and systematic approach to problem-solving and decision-making. It involves analyzing facts, data, and evidence to arrive at a conclusion. Rational thinkers use structured methodologies and often rely on quantitative analysis. This type of thinking is methodical and aims to minimize biases and errors. An example of rational thinking is using a decision matrix to evaluate various options based on specific criteria.

**Intuitive Thinking**: Intuitive thinking, on the other hand, relies on instincts, gut feelings, and personal experiences. It is a more spontaneous and holistic approach to decision-making. Intuitive thinkers often make judgments quickly without extensive data analysis. This type of thinking can be beneficial in situations where time is limited or when dealing with complex issues that cannot be easily quantified. An example of intuitive thinking is a project manager making a quick decision based on their past experiences and understanding of the team dynamics.

### Divergent versus Convergent Thinking

**Divergent Thinking**: Divergent thinking is a creative process used to generate multiple ideas and solutions. It involves exploring many possible options and thinking outside the box. Divergent thinkers seek to expand the range of possible solutions and are not constrained by traditional boundaries or norms. This type of thinking is essential during brainstorming sessions and when trying to innovate or solve complex problems. An example of divergent thinking is a team coming up with various creative ideas for a new product feature.

**Convergent Thinking**: Convergent thinking is the process of narrowing down multiple ideas into a single, optimal solution. It involves critical evaluation, analysis, and logical reasoning to select the best option from the generated ideas. Convergent thinkers focus on finding the most effective and practical solution by eliminating less viable options. This type of thinking is crucial when making final decisions and implementing solutions. An example of convergent thinking is a team evaluating the feasibility of various product features and selecting the one that best meets customer needs and project constraints.

### Contractive versus Expansive Thinking

**Contractive Thinking**: Contractive thinking involves focusing on specific components or subsystems within a larger system to narrow down options and identify the most effective solution. It emphasizes critical evaluation and logical reasoning to eliminate less viable alternatives and converge on a single, optimal course of action. For example, a team might use contractive thinking to analyze different strategies for optimizing a particular process within a larger organizational system, selecting the one that best aligns with overall system goals and performance metrics.

**Expansive Thinking**: Expansive thinking involves looking at the system as a whole and considering a wide range of possibilities and interactions between different components. It encourages creativity and innovation by exploring unconventional solutions and understanding how changes in one part of the system may impact the whole. This approach is particularly useful during the early stages of system design or when addressing complex problems that require holistic and out-of-the-box solutions. For example, a team might engage in expansive thinking to brainstorm various approaches for improving overall system efficiency, considering how different changes might interact and produce emergent properties.

### Decision-Making Personal Biases

Personal biases can significantly impact the decision-making process, often leading to suboptimal choices. Recognizing and mitigating these biases is crucial for making objective and effective decisions. Common personal biases in decision-making include:

- **Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to seek out and favor information that confirms pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses while ignoring or discounting contradictory evidence. This can lead to one-sided decisions that overlook important considerations.
- **Anchoring Bias**: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions. This can skew the decision-making process, as subsequent information is interpreted based on the initial anchor.
- **Overconfidence Bias**: The tendency to overestimate one's own abilities, knowledge, or the accuracy of one's predictions. Overconfidence can result in taking excessive risks or disregarding potential pitfalls.
- **Availability Bias**: The tendency to overemphasize information that is readily available or recent, rather than considering all relevant information. This can lead to decisions based on incomplete or skewed data.
- **Hindsight Bias**: The tendency to see events as having been predictable after they have already occurred. This can result in an unrealistic assessment of past decision-making processes and an overestimation of one's ability to predict future events.
- **Groupthink**: The tendency for group members to conform to a consensus opinion without critical evaluation, often to maintain harmony and avoid conflict. Groupthink can suppress dissenting viewpoints and lead to poor decision-making.
- **Status Quo Bias**: The preference for maintaining the current state of affairs rather than making changes. This can result in resistance to new ideas or innovations, even when they may be beneficial.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: The tendency to continue investing in a decision based on the cumulative prior investment (time, money, resources) rather than evaluating the current and future benefits. This can lead to continued commitment to failing projects or strategies.
- **Ego Bias**: The tendency to make decisions that enhance one's self-image or align with one's personal interests, rather than making objective choices that benefit the project or organization.

To mitigate personal biases in decision-making, individuals and teams can adopt several strategies:

- **Awareness and Education**: Educate team members about common biases and their impact on decision-making. Awareness is the first step in recognizing and addressing biases.
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Encourage input from a diverse group of stakeholders to ensure a variety of viewpoints are considered. This can help counteract individual biases.
- **Structured Decision-Making Processes**: Implement formal decision-making frameworks and methodologies that promote objective analysis and critical evaluation of alternatives.
- **Devil's Advocacy**: Assign a team member to play the role of "devil's advocate" to challenge assumptions and highlight potential flaws in the decision-making process.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Base decisions on empirical data and evidence rather than intuition or personal preferences. Ensure that all relevant information is considered.
- **Reflection and Review**: Regularly review and reflect on past decisions to identify instances of bias and learn from them. This can improve future decision-making processes.
- **External Input**: Seek input from external experts or advisors who can provide an unbiased perspective and help identify potential biases.

By actively addressing personal biases, project teams can enhance the quality and objectivity of their decision-making processes, leading to better outcomes and project success.

### Types of Decision-Makers

- **The Autocratic Decision-Maker**: This type of decision-maker prefers to make decisions unilaterally, without seeking input or consensus from others. They rely on their own judgment and authority to make choices, often in a top-down manner. While this approach can be efficient and quick, it may lead to a lack of buy-in and resistance from team members.
- **The Fearful Decision-Maker**: A fearful decision-maker is hesitant and often delays making decisions due to a fear of making the wrong choice. They may seek excessive amounts of information and reassurance before committing to a decision, which can result in missed opportunities and prolonged indecision.
- **The Circular Decision-Maker**: This decision-maker has difficulty arriving at a final decision and tends to go in circles, revisiting the same issues and options repeatedly. They may struggle with overanalyzing and second-guessing, leading to indecision and a lack of progress.
- **The Democratic Decision-Maker**: A democratic decision-maker involves the entire team in the decision-making process, seeking input and consensus from all members. This approach fosters collaboration and buy-in but can be time-consuming and may lead to compromises that are not optimal.
- **The Self-Serving Decision-Maker**: This type of decision-maker prioritizes their own interests and benefits when making decisions, often at the expense of the team's or organization's goals. Their choices may be influenced by personal gain, recognition, or career advancement, rather than the best outcome for the project or team.

### Challenges in Decision Making

1. **Information Overload**: This occurs when the sheer volume of data and information available becomes overwhelming, making it challenging to process and analyze effectively. Decision-makers may struggle to identify which information is most relevant and critical for the decision at hand, leading to potential delays or poor-quality decisions.
2. **Uncertainty and Risk**: Many decisions are made with incomplete information and involve unpredictable outcomes. Uncertainty and risk force decision-makers to make educated guesses or assumptions about future events, which can be daunting. This often requires risk assessment and the development of contingency plans to mitigate potential negative impacts.
3. **Time Constraints**: Often, decisions need to be made within a limited timeframe, adding pressure to the decision-making process. Time constraints can lead to rushed decisions without thorough analysis, potentially overlooking important factors or viable alternatives.
4. **Conflicting Interests**: Decision-making can become complicated when different stakeholders have varying goals, priorities, and interests. These conflicts can create disagreements and delays, making it difficult to reach a consensus or find a solution that satisfies all parties involved.
5. **Biases and Heuristics**: Personal biases and mental shortcuts (heuristics) can significantly influence decision-making. These biases can lead to skewed judgments and suboptimal decisions. Common examples include confirmation bias, where individuals favor information that confirms their preconceptions, and anchoring bias, where the first piece of information encountered disproportionately affects subsequent judgments.
6. **Complexity of Problems**: Many decisions involve multifaceted and intricate issues that are not easily solved. Complex problems often require comprehensive analysis and innovative thinking to address effectively. Breaking down these problems into smaller, more manageable parts can help in formulating viable solutions.
7. **Resource Limitations**: Limited resources, such as time, budget, or personnel, can constrain the decision-making process.

# Decision-Making Tools

## Operations Research and Management Science Models

Management science is often viewed solely as a mathematical or quantitative approach to decision-making. It is much more: a totality of many philosophies and techniques used in a systematic way to help the decision-maker make decisions.

## Decision-Making Tools in Project Management

SWOT Analysis: SWOT analysis stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It is a strategic planning tool used to identify internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving project objectives. By thoroughly analyzing these factors, project managers can develop robust strategies to leverage strengths, mitigate weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and guard against potential threats. This comprehensive analysis helps in making well-informed decisions by providing a clear picture of the current situation and potential future scenarios, ensuring that all aspects of the project are considered. Components of SWOT analysis include:

- Strengths: Internal attributes that are beneficial to achieving project objectives.
- Weaknesses: Internal attributes that could hinder project success.
- Opportunities: External factors that the project could exploit to its advantage.
- Threats: External factors that could cause trouble for the project.
    - Example: A company launching a new product might use SWOT analysis to identify its strengths (e.g., strong brand reputation), weaknesses (e.g., limited marketing budget), opportunities (e.g., growing market demand), and threats (e.g., increasing competition).

### Pareto Analysis: Also known as the 80/20 rule, Pareto Analysis is used to prioritize issues or tasks based on their impact. It suggests that 80% of problems are often due to 20% of causes. By identifying and focusing on these key causes, project managers can optimize resource allocation and address the most significant issues first. This method is particularly useful for improving efficiency and effectiveness by concentrating efforts on the areas that will have the most significant impact, thus ensuring that resources are used in the most productive way possible. Components of Pareto Analysis include:

- Identifying Problems: Listing all problems or defects.
- Measuring Frequency: Determining how often each problem occurs.
- Prioritizing: Focusing on the problems that occur most frequently.
    - Example: A manufacturing company might use Pareto Analysis to identify that 80% of defects in their products are caused by 20% of the production process issues, allowing them to target and resolve the most critical problems.

### Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA): MCDA is a decision-making process that evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making. This tool helps project managers to make decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors, such as cost, benefits, risks, and stakeholder preferences. MCDA is essential in complex projects where multiple variables need to be considered, ensuring that decisions are balanced and aligned with overall project goals. Components of MCDA include:

- Criteria Identification: Listing all relevant criteria.
- Weighting Criteria: Assigning importance to each criterion.
- Evaluating Alternatives: Scoring each alternative against the criteria.
    - Example: A city planning project might use MCDA to evaluate different transportation options, considering factors such as cost, environmental impact, and public approval.

### Paired Comparison Analysis: This tool helps in comparing the relative importance or preference of options by comparing them in pairs. Each option is compared against every other option, and a score is assigned based on preference or importance. The scores are then aggregated to determine the best option. Paired Comparison Analysis is particularly useful when decision-makers need to evaluate a set of competing options and prioritize them effectively. Components of Paired Comparison Analysis include:

- Listing Options: Identifying all options to be compared.
- Pairwise Comparison: Comparing each option against every other option.
- Scoring: Assigning scores based on preference or importance.
    - Example: A company might use Paired Comparison Analysis to decide between multiple new product ideas by comparing each idea against the others based on criteria such as market potential and development cost.

### Decision Trees: Decision trees are graphical representations of possible solutions to a decision based on different sequences of events. They help project managers visualize the outcomes of various actions and make informed decisions by evaluating the potential risks and benefits. Decision trees are useful for mapping out complex decisions and understanding the implications of different choices, making it easier to select the most advantageous path. Components of Decision Trees include:

- Nodes: Points representing decisions or chance events.
- Branches: Lines representing possible actions or outcomes.
- Leaves: End points representing final outcomes.
    - Example: A software development company might use a decision tree to decide whether to add a new feature to their product, considering factors such as development time, cost, and potential revenue.

### Influence Diagrams: Influence diagrams are visual representations that show the relationships among decisions, uncertainties, and objectives. They help project managers understand the dependencies and influences between different factors, enabling better decision-making. Influence diagrams simplify complex decision-making processes by highlighting key variables and their interconnections, facilitating a more holistic approach to problem-solving. Components of Influence Diagrams include:

- Nodes: Represent decisions, uncertainties, and objectives.
- Arrows: Show the influences between nodes.
- Outcome Nodes: Represent the final outcomes.
    - Example: A healthcare organization might use an influence diagram to understand the factors affecting patient satisfaction, such as wait times, quality of care, and staff behavior.

### Affinity Diagrams: Affinity diagrams are used to organize ideas and data into groups based on natural relationships. This tool helps project managers to identify patterns and themes, making it easier to analyze complex information and generate insights. Affinity diagrams are particularly useful during brainstorming sessions and when dealing with large amounts of qualitative data, helping to structure and prioritize information effectively. Components of Affinity Diagrams include:

- Idea Generation: Collecting ideas or data.
- Grouping: Organizing ideas into related groups.
- Labeling: Naming each group based on its theme.
    - Example: A marketing team might use an affinity diagram to organize customer feedback from surveys into categories such as product features, customer service, and pricing.

### Game Theory: Game theory is the study of strategic decision-making where multiple players make decisions that affect each other. In project management, game theory can be used to analyze competitive scenarios and develop strategies that consider the actions and reactions of other stakeholders. By understanding the strategic interactions between different parties, project managers can make more informed decisions that account for potential competitive responses. Components of Game Theory include:

- Players: Individuals or entities making decisions.
- Strategies: Possible actions each player can take.
- Payoffs: Outcomes resulting from the combination of strategies.
    - Example: A company might use game theory to plan its pricing strategy in a competitive market, considering the potential reactions of its competitors.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA): CBA is a financial analysis tool used to evaluate the costs and benefits of a project or decision. It involves identifying, quantifying, and comparing the costs and benefits to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs. Components of CBA include direct and indirect costs, tangible and intangible benefits, and the time value of money. CBA provides a clear financial rationale for decision-making, ensuring that resources are allocated to projects that offer the highest net benefits. Components of CBA include:

- Cost Identification: Listing all relevant costs.
- Benefit Identification: Listing all relevant benefits.
- Comparison: Comparing the total costs and benefits.
    - Example: A government agency might use CBA to evaluate the feasibility of building a new public transportation system, comparing the costs of construction and maintenance with the benefits of reduced traffic congestion and pollution.

### Nominal Group Technique (NGT): NGT is a structured method for group brainstorming that encourages contributions from all participants. It involves generating ideas individually, sharing them with the group, discussing, and then ranking the ideas. This technique helps project managers gather diverse inputs and make collective decisions. NGT is particularly effective in ensuring that all voices are heard and considered, leading to more democratic and inclusive decision-making processes. Components of NGT include:

- Idea Generation: Individual brainstorming.
- Idea Sharing: Group discussion of ideas.
- Ranking: Voting on the best ideas.
    - Example: A project team might use NGT to brainstorm and prioritize potential features for a new software application, ensuring that all team members' ideas are considered.

### Delphi Technique: The Delphi technique is a structured communication method used to gather expert opinions on a specific topic. It involves multiple rounds of anonymous surveys, where experts provide their insights, and the results are aggregated and shared with the group. This iterative process helps reach a consensus on complex issues. The Delphi technique is valuable for decision-making in uncertain or ambiguous situations, where expert judgment is critical. Components of the Delphi Technique include:

- Survey Rounds: Multiple rounds of questionnaires.
- Anonymity: Ensuring participants' responses are anonymous.
- Feedback: Sharing aggregated results with participants.
    - Example: A research organization might use the Delphi technique to gather expert opinions on future technological trends, helping to guide their long-term research strategy.

### Linear Programming: Linear programming is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a given model. It involves defining a set of linear equations and inequalities that represent constraints and objectives. Project managers can use linear programming to optimize resource allocation and scheduling. This method is particularly useful for solving complex problems involving multiple variables and constraints, ensuring that resources are used efficiently. Components of Linear Programming include:

- Decision Variables: Variables representing choices to be made.
- Objective Function: The function to be optimized.
- Constraints: Equations or inequalities representing limitations.
    - Example: A logistics company might use linear programming to optimize its delivery routes, minimizing transportation costs while meeting delivery deadlines.

### Trial and Error Solutions: Trial and error is an iterative problem-solving method where multiple solutions are tested, and the best one is selected based on the results. This approach is useful when there is no clear solution, and project managers need to experiment to find the most effective strategy. Trial and error is particularly valuable in innovative projects, where traditional methods may not apply, and flexibility is essential. Components of Trial and Error Solutions include:

- Experimentation: Trying different approaches.
- Evaluation: Assessing the effectiveness of each approach.
- Selection: Choosing the best solution based on results.
    - Example: A tech startup might use trial and error to refine its product features, testing different versions with users to determine which features are most popular and effective.

# Developing Alternatives

A major part of problem-solving and ultimately decision-making involves the identification and analysis of a finite set of alternatives described in terms of some evaluative criteria. These criteria may be benefit or cost in nature, or the criteria could simply be the adherence to the cost, schedule, and scope baselines of the project. Then the problem might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another goal might be to just find the best alternative or to determine the relative priority of each alternative.

Because of the complexity of projects, the project manager cannot be expected to determine all of the alternatives in a vacuum. The team should be involved in the identification and prioritization of the alternatives. If the team does not have the expertise to determine the alternatives, then the project manager may need additional support from the subject matter experts in the functional areas. There are also situations where the stakeholders or external contractors may be able to provide the necessary information for determining alternatives.

## Variable to Consider During Alternative Analyses

There are several variables that must be considered when identifying and selecting alternatives. The variables are usually project-specific and based upon the size, nature, and complexity of the problem. However, we can identify a core list of variables that usually apply to the identification and evaluation of most alternatives:

- Cost: there is a cost associated with each alternative. This includes not only the cost of implementing the alternative, but the financial impact on the remaining work on the project.
- Schedule: implementing an alternative takes time. If the implementation time is too long or cannot be done in parallel with the other project work, then there may be a significant impact on the end date of the project.
- Quality: care must be taken that the speed to resolve a problem does not result in a degradation of quality in the project's deliverables.
- Resources: implementing a solution requires resources. The problem is that the people needed with the necessary skills may not be available.
- Feasibility: some alternatives may seem plausible on paper but may be unfeasible when needed to be implemented. Feasibility or complexity of the alternative must be considered. Otherwise, you could make the problem worse.
- Risks: some alternatives expose the company to increased risks. These may be future risks (or even opportunities) that will appear well after the project is completed.

## Understanding the Features That Are Part of the Alternatives

Previously, we discussed some of the variables that must be considered looking at alternatives. Now, we look a little deeper into the features that are part of the alternatives. Many times, there are several features that can be included in each of the alternatives. Part of understanding the boundary conditions is to know the importance of each feature. The features can be classified as:

- Must have: any alternative that does not include this feature should be discarded.
- Should have: these are features that in most situations should be included in the alternatives that are being considered. Failure to consider these could result in a degradation of performance. Some of these features may be omitted if including them results in unfavorable consequences when trying to satisfy the competing constraints.
- Might have: these are usually add-ons to enhance performance but not necessarily part of the project's requirements. These are nice-to-have items but not a necessity when deciding upon a final solution. Might have features are often characterized as bells and whistles that are part of gold-plating efforts.

## Developing Hybrid Alternatives

Hybrid alternatives involve the combination of different features from multiple alternatives to create a new, optimized solution. This approach allows for greater flexibility and creativity in problem-solving, as it leverages the strengths of various options while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

To develop hybrid alternatives, the project team should:

1. Identify Core Features: Review the list of features from all considered alternatives and identify the core elements that are essential to the project. These should include both "must have" and "should have" features.
2. Combine Features Logically: Look for logical combinations of features that complement each other and enhance the overall effectiveness of the solution. This step often involves brainstorming sessions and iterative discussions among team members and stakeholders.
3. Evaluate Feasibility: Assess the feasibility of the hybrid alternative by considering factors such as cost, schedule, quality, resources, and risks. Ensure that the combination of features does not introduce new complexities or unrealistic demands.
4. Prototype and Test: If possible, create a prototype of the hybrid alternative and conduct tests to evaluate its performance. This step helps in identifying potential issues early and allows for further refinement of the solution.
5. Seek Feedback: Involve stakeholders, subject matter experts, and end-users in the evaluation process. Their feedback can provide valuable insights into the practicality and desirability of the hybrid alternative.

By systematically combining and evaluating features, hybrid alternatives can offer innovative and effective solutions that might not be apparent when considering individual alternatives in isolation. This approach fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and promotes collaborative decision-making, ultimately leading to better project outcomes.

## Phantom Alternatives

Phantom alternatives are options that are not fully developed or real, but are introduced to provide a basis for comparison or to stimulate creative thinking. These alternatives can play a crucial role in the decision-making process by helping the team to think outside the box and consider unconventional solutions. While phantom alternatives may not be immediately viable, they can inspire new ideas and lead to the discovery of innovative approaches that might otherwise be overlooked.

An example of phantom alternatives could be during a software development project. Suppose the team is brainstorming ways to improve user engagement on a mobile app. One phantom alternative might be the idea of integrating virtual reality (VR) features into the app. Although this option is not immediately viable due to budget constraints and current technological limitations, discussing it can spark creative thinking. This could lead the team to consider more feasible alternatives, such as adding augmented reality (AR) elements or interactive tutorials, which can enhance user engagement without the need for high costs and advanced technology.

When considering phantom alternatives, it is important to:

1. Encourage Creativity: Allow team members to propose ideas without the constraints of feasibility or practicality. This can lead to unexpected and innovative solutions that challenge conventional thinking.
2. Evaluate Hypothetically: Assess these alternatives as if they were real, considering their potential impacts on cost, schedule, quality, resources, and risks. This process can highlight new angles and considerations that can be applied to real alternatives.
3. Extract Valuable Features: Identify any valuable features or concepts within the phantom alternatives that could be incorporated into real alternatives or hybrid solutions. Even if the entire alternative is not feasible, parts of it might be useful.
4. Foster Open Discussion: Use phantom alternatives to stimulate discussion and debate among team members and stakeholders. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the problem and more robust solutions.
5. Document Insights: Keep a record of insights and ideas generated from the consideration of phantom alternatives. These can be revisited later and might prove useful in future projects or problem-solving scenarios.

By incorporating phantom alternatives into the decision-making process, project teams can enhance their creativity and broaden their perspective. This approach encourages innovative thinking and can lead to the identification of unique and effective solutions that might not emerge through traditional problem-solving methods alone.

## Tradeoffs

In the process of developing and selecting alternatives, understanding and managing tradeoffs is essential. Tradeoffs involve balancing competing factors and making decisions that may prioritize certain criteria over others. This often requires a careful consideration of the consequences of each choice and an evaluation of how each alternative aligns with the project's overall goals.

Key Considerations for Tradeoffs:

1. Cost vs. Quality: Increasing quality often comes with higher costs. Project managers must decide whether the benefits of higher quality justify the additional expenses. In some cases, a lower-cost alternative with acceptable quality may be more desirable.
2. Schedule vs. Scope: Expanding the scope of a project can extend the schedule. Managers need to determine whether the additional features or tasks are worth the delay in project completion. Sometimes, delivering a project on time with a reduced scope is more critical.
3. Short-term vs. Long-term Benefits: Some alternatives may offer immediate benefits but have long-term drawbacks, while others may require significant upfront investment but provide greater long-term value. Evaluating the time horizon for benefits is crucial.
4. Innovation vs. Feasibility: Innovative solutions can bring substantial advantages but may also carry higher risks and uncertainties. Balancing the desire for innovation with the feasibility of implementation is an important consideration.
5. Resource Allocation: Limited resources must be allocated efficiently. This may involve tradeoffs between different projects or between various components of the same project. Ensuring optimal use of resources while maintaining project objectives is a key challenge.
6. Risk vs. Reward: Every alternative comes with its own set of risks and potential rewards. Project managers must assess the likelihood and impact of risks associated with each alternative and weigh them against the expected benefits.

### Steps to Manage Tradeoffs:

1. Identify Priorities: Clearly define the project's priorities and objectives. Understanding what is most important helps guide decisions when faced with tradeoffs.
2. Engage Stakeholders: Involve stakeholders in discussions about tradeoffs to gain diverse perspectives and ensure that their needs and concerns are considered.
3. Use Decision-Making Tools: Utilize tools such as decision matrices, cost-benefit analyses, and risk assessments to systematically evaluate tradeoffs and support informed decision-making.
4. Communicate Transparently: Keep all team members and stakeholders informed about the tradeoffs being considered and the rationale behind decisions. Transparency builds trust and ensures alignment.
5. Monitor and Adjust: Continuously monitor the impact of tradeoffs on the project's progress and outcomes. Be prepared to make adjustments as needed to stay on track with project objectives.

By carefully considering tradeoffs and making informed decisions, project managers can navigate the complexities of alternative development and selection, ultimately leading to successful project outcomes.

### Common Mistakes When Developing Alternatives

1. Lack of Thorough Analysis: One of the most common mistakes is failing to conduct a thorough analysis of all potential alternatives. This can lead to missed opportunities and suboptimal decision-making. It is crucial to take the time to evaluate each alternative comprehensively, considering all relevant criteria such as cost, schedule, quality, resources, feasibility, and risks.
2. Ignoring Stakeholder Input: Not involving stakeholders in the development and evaluation of alternatives can result in solutions that do not meet their needs or expectations. Stakeholders often provide valuable insights and perspectives that can help in identifying and prioritizing the best alternatives. Engaging them early and throughout the process is essential.
3. Overlooking Feasibility: Some alternatives may appear attractive on paper but are impractical when it comes to implementation. Failing to assess the feasibility of alternatives can lead to wasted time and resources. It is important to consider the technical, financial, and operational feasibility of each option before making a decision.
4. Tunnel Vision: Focusing too narrowly on a single solution or a limited set of alternatives can prevent the identification of more innovative or effective options. It is important to maintain an open mind and explore a wide range of possibilities. Encouraging creativity and out-of-the-box thinking can help in discovering unique solutions.
5. Inadequate Risk Assessment: Not adequately assessing the risks associated with each alternative can lead to unforeseen challenges and negative impacts on the project. It is important to conduct a thorough risk assessment for each option, considering both short-term and long-term risks. This includes identifying potential risks, evaluating their likelihood and impact, and developing mitigation strategies.
6. Failure to Prioritize: Not prioritizing the features and criteria that are most important to the project can lead to confusion and indecision. It is essential to clearly define the "must have," "should have," and "might have" features and use them to guide the evaluation and selection process. This helps in focusing on the most critical aspects and making informed tradeoffs.
7. Poor Communication: Failing to communicate the rationale behind the selection of alternatives can result in misunderstandings and lack of buy-in from team members and stakeholders. It is important to clearly articulate the reasons for choosing a particular alternative, including the benefits, tradeoffs, and potential risks. Transparent communication fosters trust and alignment.
8. Neglecting to Revisit Alternatives: Once an alternative is selected, it is important to periodically revisit and reassess it in light of new information or changing project conditions. Sticking rigidly to an initial decision without considering evolving circumstances can lead to suboptimal outcomes. Being flexible and willing to adjust the chosen alternative as needed is crucial for project success.

By being aware of these common mistakes and taking steps to avoid them, project managers and teams can improve their alternative development process and make more informed, effective decisions.

## General Factors Influencing Project Scope Changes

There are numerous factors that determine the number and extent of contract changes on a particular project. Consequently, projects run the gamut from no changes to a flood of changes. Some of the factors that influence the extent of contract changes include:

- The Customer: The nature and volume of change problems can be markedly influenced by the particular customer, particular individuals and their attitudes, and practices relative to changes. This occurs frequently on projects where the customer is not sure of the effort needed to satisfy their needs or when an individual has a hidden agenda that they wish to fulfill. Every effort should be made to discern these factors early in the contract and to be guided accordingly.
- Life Cycle Phases: The nature, cost, and schedule impacts of contract changes vary considerably as the project progresses through its “life cycle” phases from concept formation to full-scale execution. For any given change, the earlier the change is made, the less will be its cost and schedule impact. A repeat order of items to be manufactured would normally be expected to experience a minimum of change.
- Concurrency of Life Cycle Phases: The term concurrency has come into increased usage by some customers to describe a contract situation that requires life cycle phases to overlap. This can significantly increase project risks and create additional problems if work that is best to be performed in series is requested to be performed in parallel. For example, hardware manufacturing that is begun prior to completion of testing and prototype studies can be expected to increase the volume of problems and resulting scope changes.
- Multilocations and Subcontractors: The involvement of more than one operating location, major subcontractors, and associate contractors will result in multiple interfaces which may create changes internally and possibly at the customer interface. As an example, based upon the interaction of subcontractors, a consensus might not occur for a scope change that impacts each party differently.
- Project/Program Size and Duration: The magnitude of changes will normally increase with the size of the project/program.
- Type of Contract: The type of contract can influence the extent of change. Considering a fixed-price contract in contrast to a CPFF contract, it is likely that the parties involved on both sides will be more sensitive to scope definition and the impact of scope changes.
- Timing of Change: In relation to many changes, there is a critical time at which they should be officially approved and initiated. In such cases, project issues and costs may increase rapidly if approval and initiation of work are delayed beyond this critical point in time.

## Timing for Problem Identification

Early recognition of potential problems that could result in a scope change is important. There is a tendency in the early stages of a project to minimize the importance of minor changes and to consider that they will not have a serious impact on the project.

Coupled with this attitude, there is a tendency toward easy acceptance of the view that a change or modification of requirements probably was or should have been considered a part of the initial requirements.

Every attempt should be made to discourage such views from the outset and to emphasize the potential cumulative value of even small individual changes and the necessity for establishing proper practices and procedures for identifying and processing problems that could lead to larger changes as the project progresses.

At the opposite extreme, however, spending money and irritating the customer over real trivia must be avoided. The project manager is the individual responsible to decide what changes should be pursued on a contract and must establish procedures so that prospective changes are brought to his/her attention for consideration.

# Development Approach and Life Cycle

A phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables.

Project Phase: a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables

Project Life Cycle: the series of phases that a project passes through, from its start to its completion

Iterative Life cycle: an adaptive life cycle in which development occurs through continuous refinement over the life of the project

Incremental life cycle: an adaptive life cycle in which development occurs in small increments, gradually forming the end deliverable through segments

Delivery cadence: the timing and frequency of project deliverables

A stage gate is a point for deciding whether a project should be continued or terminated.

Deliverable: any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.

Development approach: A method used to create and evolve a product, service or result during the project life cycle, such as a predictive, adaptive, or hybrid method. The development approach can demonstrate specific characteristics, such as being iterative or incremental.

With the predictive development approach, you design and implement a project in a life cycle sequenced in distinct phases, from the initial conceptual and feasibility phase to the deployment of the final product or service.

An adaptive development approach is practical when requirements are subject to a high level of uncertainty and volatility and are likely to change throughout the project.

A hybrid development approach is a combination of adaptive and predictive approaches. This means that some elements from a predictive approach are used along with some elements from an adaptive approach.

## Product, Service, or Result

Factors influencing the deliverable (product, service, or result):

1. Degree of innovation: This refers to how novel or groundbreaking the product, service, or result is. Higher degrees of innovation often bring more uncertainty and risk, requiring more adaptive and flexible approaches.
2. Requirements certainty: This factor assesses how well-defined and stable the project requirements are. Projects with high requirements certainty can often use more predictive approaches, while those with uncertain requirements may need adaptive approaches.
3. Scope stability: This measures how likely the project scope is to change over time. Projects with stable scopes can benefit from predictive approaches, whereas projects with evolving scopes may need adaptive or hybrid approaches to manage changes effectively.
4. Ease of change: This considers how easily changes can be implemented in the project. Projects where changes are difficult and costly may prefer predictive approaches to minimize alterations, while those where changes are easier may adopt more adaptive approaches.
5. Delivery cadence: This refers to how the final product, service, or result will be delivered and the frequency of deliveries. Projects with fixed deadlines and delivery schedules might use predictive approaches, whereas those with flexible deliveries might opt for adaptive approaches.
6. Risk: This encompasses the potential uncertainties and challenges that could affect the project. High-risk projects often require adaptive approaches to respond to changes and mitigate risks effectively.
7. Regulatory Requirements: This includes compliance with safety standards and regulatory requirements. Projects with stringent safety and regulatory needs may need more structured and predictive approaches to ensure compliance.

## Project

1. Stakeholders: Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who have an interest in the outcome of the project. They can influence the project's direction and success. Effective stakeholder management involves identifying all stakeholders, understanding their needs and expectations, and engaging them appropriately throughout the project lifecycle. This ensures that their interests are considered, and potential conflicts are addressed early.
2. Schedule Constraints: Schedule constraints refer to the limitations on the project's timeline. These constraints can be due to fixed deadlines, resource availability, or external factors such as market conditions or regulatory requirements. Managing schedule constraints involves careful planning, setting realistic timelines, and continuously monitoring progress to ensure the project stays on track. Flexibility and adaptability are crucial when dealing with unexpected delays or changes.
3. Funding availability: Funding availability concerns the financial resources allocated to the project. Adequate funding is essential for acquiring necessary resources, paying team members, and covering other project costs. Managing funding involves budgeting, forecasting, and ensuring that expenditures align with the project's financial plan. It also requires securing additional funds if needed and being transparent about financial status with stakeholders.

## Organization

1. Organizational structure: The organizational structure defines how roles, responsibilities, and authority are distributed within the organization. It can impact the project's workflow, communication, and decision-making processes. Understanding the organizational structure helps in identifying key decision-makers, understanding reporting lines, and navigating internal processes efficiently. The structure can be hierarchical, matrixed, or flat, each with its own advantages and challenges for project management.
2. Culture: Organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, norms, and practices that shape the behavior and interactions of members within the organization. It can significantly impact how projects are managed and executed. A positive and supportive culture can foster collaboration, innovation, and employee engagement, while a negative culture can lead to resistance to change, poor communication, and low morale. Understanding the existing culture is crucial for project managers to align their strategies and approaches with the organization's values and to effectively manage change.
3. Organizational capability: This encompasses the organization's ability to execute projects successfully, including the skills, competencies, tools, and processes available. It involves assessing the organization's strengths and weaknesses in project management, such as having experienced project managers, robust project management methodologies, and effective resource allocation systems. Enhancing organizational capability may require investing in training, improving processes, and adopting new technologies to ensure that projects are delivered efficiently and effectively.
4. Project team size and location: The size and geographical distribution of the project team can influence communication, coordination, and overall project management. Larger teams may offer a broader range of skills and expertise but can also present challenges in terms of coordination and conflict resolution. Geographically dispersed teams, or remote teams, can benefit from diverse perspectives but may face difficulties in communication and collaboration due to time zone differences and cultural variations. Effective project management in such scenarios involves leveraging technology for virtual communication, establishing clear communication protocols, and fostering a sense of team cohesion despite physical distances.

# Predictive Methodologies

A **process** is simply a series of activities that you execute to achieve an outcome. 

- Specifically, it is a way of transforming known inputs into an output using established tools and techniques.

Processes can be grouped into the ***Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling*** and ***Closing** Process Groups.* 

The **initiating processes** are performed to define a new project or even a new phase of the same project. 

The primary purpose of developing a *project charter* is to identify the project vision, scope, deliverables, execution, organization, and implementation plan. 

**Planning processes** outline the strategy and tactics to plan and organize a project successfully. 

**Executing processes** are performed to deliver the work defined in a project plan. 

**Monitoring and Controlling processes** are performed to ensure that a project is on track and will deliver the project requirements to the planned specifications. 

- Change control processes are also executed to ensure that changes to the plan are made.

**Closing processes** are performed to complete a phase or an entire project.  

A **project charter** grants authority to the project manager to spend money and assign resources. It also documents high-level project requirements— at least, those that are known at the point of developing the charter.

- A charter may include a formal preliminary scope statement.

The **SMART acronym** is widely used to craft a complete project charter. SMART stands for **specific**, **measurable**, **action-oriented**, **relevant**, and **time-limited**. 

For a camping project, the **SMART objectives** are as follows: 

- **Specific**: The goal is to accomplish a 5-day outdoor camping trip.
- **Measurable**: The goal is 70% participation from the membership; a survey upon completion of camp reveals 95% satisfaction with the trip.
- **Action-oriented**: The school camping trip will allow students to be close to nature, to network, and to build lasting memories.
- **Relevant**: The project is attainable with existing resources.
- **Time-bound**: The camping trip will start on June 1 and end on June 6.

### Develop Project Team

Typical project management processes for this phase are:

- Develop Team
- Estimate Resources
- Acquire Resources
- Manage Team

### Develop Project Management Plan

A **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the deliverables. It organizes and defines the total work scope of the project, breaking it down into manageable sections that can be executed by the project team.

The following project planning steps result in the creation of the baselines:

- Collect requirements
- Define scope (create scope statement)
- Create WBS (create WBS dictionary)
- Establish approved baseline

A **resource management plan** lists key project development team members and their assignments in relation to the WBS. It also lists key personnel, such as external vendors that are responsible for various elements of the project, as well as the physical resources required for project execution.

A **communications management** **plan** shows how the project interfaces with other components and with the customer or line organization stakeholders; provides forms and templates for reports, communications, dashboards; and includes policies for communicating across organizational boundaries or hierarchical levels in the project.

A **risk management plan** lists risks sorted in order of probability and impact and includes a risk response plan for each, including possible costs/budget for managing risks.

A **scope management plan** describes the policies and procedures for developing scope and changes to scope.

A **cost management plan** details the policies and procedures for establishing controls on project costs and measuring variance in actual cost from planned cost and specifies approaches for managing the project within the appropriate cost constraints.

A **quality management plan** describes the means through which the project deliverables are expected to be of a certain level of quality and also describes the various project components that will ensure that level. This sort of plan includes approaches to testing supplies and parts, evaluating execution steps, and measuring deliverable quality. Additionally, it specifies the types of quality reports and controls.

A **procurement management plan** typically details the requirements for establishing bidding documents, the approaches to publishing the documents according to possible legal requirements, potential bidder qualifications and the opportunity to gain clarification about the requirements, the evaluation of bids, and the awarding and management of contracts.

Once the resources are planed, the schedule is typically illustrated graphically. 

A **Gantt chart** is a type of bar chart that represents a project schedule. It shows the start and finish dates of the various elements of a project. Gantt charts are used to visualize project timelines, track progress, and determine the relationship between tasks. Each task is represented by a bar, with the length of the bar corresponding to the task's duration. Dependencies between tasks can also be illustrated, indicating which tasks must be completed before others can begin.

To create a **comprehensive project management plan** for a small to medium project using a predictive approach, you could best elaborate on the project management processes shown in this list:

- Collect requirements and define the scope statement.
- Create a WBS.
- Define and sequence activities.
- Estimate effort, duration, and resources.
- Identify the critical path.
- Develop a schedule.

### Collect Requirements and Define Scope Statement

Once the charter exists, the project manager is selected and will lead the effort to gather requirements and create a scope document called the scope statement. This scope document is a formal document signed by stakeholders that is referred to when making all project decisions. It defines all the products, services, and results to be provided. It ensures customer satisfaction and is the basis for avoiding scope creep.

A **Scope Statement** is a documented statement of the project's scope, including the project's deliverables and the work required to create those deliverables. It provides a detailed description of the project objectives, deliverables, boundaries, exclusions, constraints, and assumptions. The scope statement is used to provide a clear understanding of the project for all stakeholders and to guide the project team's work throughout the project lifecycle.

The Scope Statement is a critical document in project management and is comprised of several key components:

- **Goals and objectives**: These outline what the project aims to achieve, detailing the specific outcomes and overarching purpose.
- **Requirements**: This section specifies the necessary conditions and capabilities that must be met or possessed for the project to be successful.
- **Project scope**: Here, the boundaries of the project are defined, including what is included and excluded, as well as the project’s magnitude and limitations.
- **Deliverables**: These are the tangible or intangible outputs that the project will produce, which can include products, services, or results.
- **Acceptance criteria**: This part describes the conditions that must be met for the project's deliverables to be accepted by stakeholders.
- **Assumptions**: These are the statements presumed to be true for planning purposes, which can impact all aspects of the project.
- **Constraints**: These refer to the limitations or restrictions that the project must operate within, such as budget, time, resources, and technology constraints.

Each of these components plays a vital role in defining the project's scope and ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the project entails.

A **requirement** is a documented need or expectation that a particular product, system, or service must fulfill. Requirements detail the conditions or capabilities that must be met or possessed by the deliverable to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents. They serve as a basis for project planning, design, and verification.

A **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** is a document that ensures every requirement defined for a system is tested in the test protocols. It is used to track the requirements through the stages of specification, design, development, testing, and deployment. The RTM helps to ensure that all requirements are addressed and met, and it provides a means to trace the origin of each requirement and its current status. It typically includes columns for requirement IDs, descriptions, the source of the requirements, status, and links to related test cases.

Stakeholders might request scope changes during project implementation. This is a result of learning on the part of stakeholders or further understanding details as higher-level concepts are better understood. If left unaddressed, the scope of a project may gradually increase over time without being recognized as a formal project change and, therefore, without the need to possibly approve changes to the schedule and budget. This condition is called **scope creep**. 

**Scope creep** is the condition where the scope of a project gradually increases over time without being recognized as a formal project change. This can occur due to stakeholders requesting scope changes during project implementation, further understanding details, or learning new aspects as the project progresses. Unaddressed scope creep can lead to project delays, increased costs, and potential project failure.

### Create WBS

The WBS identifies all required deliverables and is the standard tool for organizing the work to be performed. The WBS defines and organizes activities involved in accomplishing the project scope. The WBS is created using a process called decomposition, which is the subdivision of the scope into smaller, more manageable pieces.

A **work package** is the smallest unit of work that can be managed and tracked in a project. It is a component of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and represents a specific task or set of tasks that can be assigned to a particular team or individual. Each work package includes detailed information about the scope, duration, cost, and resources required to complete the task. Work packages provide a clear and concise description of the work to be done, making it easier to plan, execute, and control the project.

**Step 1**: Decompose Requirements into Smaller Activities

**Step 2:** Assign Ownership to Person

**Step 3**: Specify a Measurable Deliverable

**WBS Codes** are unique identifiers assigned to each element or work package in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). These codes provide a systematic way to identify and track the various tasks, deliverables, and activities within a project. WBS codes help in organizing, managing, and reporting on the project work by offering a clear and consistent reference for each component. They typically follow a hierarchical numbering system that reflects the structure of the WBS, making it easier to navigate and understand the relationships between different elements of the project.

### Define and Sequence Activities

In this step of the project plan development, you develop the project schedule. A schedule consists of activities that are sequenced in a particular order of intended execution.

A **project schedule** is a detailed plan that outlines the project tasks, activities, milestones, and their corresponding start and finish dates. It serves as a roadmap for project execution, helping to ensure that work is completed on time and within scope. The project schedule typically includes critical path analysis, dependencies between tasks, and resource allocation to achieve the project objectives within the defined timeline.

The following illustrates the general steps leading to design of a **schedule**:

**Step 1:** Identify the lowest-level activity.

**Step 2:** Estimate the time required for the activity, keeping in mind both the availability and the capability of the resource doing the task.

**Step 3:** Determine the logical dependencies for each task.

The relationship between the predecessor and successor tasks is typically called a ***dependency*** because developing the schedule requires knowing which tasks much depend upon other tasks to start or finish first. **Four** different **types of dependencies** could be used to link the activities with each other:

1. **Finish-to-start dependency:** this dependency is the most common. It means that a specific predecessor activity must finish before the succeeding activity will start
2. **Start-to-start dependency:** this dependency indicates that the start of at least one activity depends on the start of another activity.
3. **Finish-to-finish dependency:** this dependency indicates that the finish of at least one activity depends on the finish of another activity. 
4. **Start-to-finish dependency:** this dependency is rarely used in planning. It indicates that the start of at least one activity depends on the finish of another activity. This is rare because the finish-to-start dependency actually accomplishes the same result; the difference is in which activity precedes the other

### Estimate Effort, Duration and Resources

**Analogous Estimation**: Analogous estimation, also known as top-down estimation, is a technique used in project management to estimate the duration or cost of an activity or project **based on historical data from similar projects**. This method relies on the experience and judgment of experts to draw comparisons between the current project and past projects with similar characteristics. It is often used in the early stages of project planning when detailed information is not yet available.

**Parametric Estimation**: Parametric estimation is a technique used in project management to estimate the duration, cost, or resource requirements of an activity or project based on statistical relationships between historical data and other variables. This method uses mathematical models and algorithms to calculate estimates by identifying parameters or key variables that influence the project's outcomes. Parametric estimation is generally more accurate and reliable than analogous estimation, especially when sufficient historical data and established formulas are available.

During the planning phase, a common method of estimating time for individual activities is **three-point estimation**. 

**Three-point estimation** is a technique used to estimate the time, cost, or resources required for a project task by considering three different scenarios: optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates. This method helps to account for uncertainty and provides a more accurate estimate by averaging these three values.

- **Optimistic estimate (O)**: The best-case scenario where everything goes as planned.
- **Pessimistic estimate (P)**: The worst-case scenario where things do not go as planned.
- **Most likely estimate (M)**: The most realistic scenario based on the current knowledge and conditions.

There are two common formulas used in three-point estimation:

1. **Triangular Distribution**: Estimate = (O + M + P) / 3
2. **Beta Distribution (PERT)**: Estimate = (O + 4M + P) / 6

The numbers 4, 3, and 6 in these formulas are weighted factors used to give more importance to certain estimates:

- **Triangular Distribution (O + M + P) / 3:** This formula gives equal weight to all three estimates. The divisor 3 is used to calculate the average of the three values.
- **Beta Distribution (PERT) (O + 4M + P) / 6:** This formula gives more weight to the Most Likely (M) estimate:
    - The 4 multiplier for M gives it four times the weight of O and P.
    - The divisor 6 is used because it's the sum of the weights (1 + 4 + 1 = 6).
    - This weighting reflects the assumption that the Most Likely estimate is generally more accurate.

The Beta Distribution (PERT) formula is often preferred because it accounts for the higher probability of the Most Likely scenario occurring, potentially providing a more realistic estimate in many project situations.

This estimation method was derived from the original PERT (program evaluation and review technique) method that was established early in activity network science. It is therefore also known as the PERT method for estimation.

**Duration** is the amount of time that passes on the clock or the calendar from the start of a task to the point at which it is complete, taking into account all breaks and nonwork times. It represents the total elapsed time required to complete an activity or project task.

**Effort** or **work time** is the quantity of hours it would probably take for one person to properly accomplish the activity, working alone and with no breaks, from start to finish. 

**Elapsed time** (otherwise known as **duration**) is the amount of time that passes on the clock or the calendar from the start of the task to the point at which it is complete, taking into account all breaks and all nonwork times.

### Identify Critical Path

An **activity network diagram** is a graphical representation of the sequence, dependencies, and relationships between activities in a project. It is used to visualize the flow of tasks and to identify the **critical path**, which is the longest sequence of activities that determines the shortest possible duration for completing the project. The diagram helps project managers plan, schedule, and monitor project activities by showing how tasks are interconnected and the order in which they need to be performed.

- The activity at the head of the arrow cannot start until the activity at the tail has been completely finished.

**Duration** is the amount of time that passes on the clock or the calendar from the start of a task to the point at which it is complete, taking into account all breaks and nonwork times. It represents the total elapsed time required to complete an activity or project task.

The **critical path** is the longest sequence of activities in a project that must be completed on time for the project to finish by its due date. It determines the shortest possible duration to complete the project. Any delay in the tasks on the critical path will directly impact the project's completion time. Identifying the critical path helps project managers prioritize tasks and allocate resources effectively to ensure timely project delivery.

To construct the partial network diagram, you use finish-to-start dependencies for the camping trip activities. There is a precise meaning of the arrows in such a network diagram: The activity at the head of the arrow cannot start until the activity at the tail has been completely finished.

The path A, D, E, F, G (shown as a dashed line) is the longest path through the network; it represents the shortest time in which the project can be completed. It is called the **critical path** because it determines the **total timeline** of the project.

**Float**, also known as slack, can be calculated by subtracting the early start date of an activity from its late start date, or by subtracting the early finish date from its late finish date. The float represents the amount of time that you can delay a task without it impacting the overall project completion time.

**Forward Pass**: The forward pass is a technique used in project scheduling to determine the earliest possible start and finish times for each activity in a project. By moving through the project network diagram from the start to the finish, the forward pass calculates the earliest time an activity can begin (early start, ES) and the earliest time it can be completed (early finish, EF). This helps to identify the minimum project duration and the earliest possible completion date for the entire project.

**Backward Pass**: The backward pass is a technique used in project scheduling to determine the latest possible start and finish times for each activity without delaying the project's completion. By moving through the project network diagram from the finish to the start, the backward pass calculates the latest time an activity can begin (late start, LS) and the latest time it can be completed (late finish, LF). This helps to identify the amount of slack or float available for each activity and ensures that critical path activities are completed on time.

---

A **change request** is a formal proposal for an alteration to some aspect of a project, such as its scope, schedule, budget, or resources. It typically involves documenting the change, evaluating its impact, and obtaining approval from the appropriate authority before implementation.

A *change request* needs to be approved formally. A project manager can conduct a variance analysis to evaluate the possible significance of the impact of the change on the project. If the request is approved, the project manager will need to compare the **scope baseline** against the change and create a new baseline.

The typical process for **managing change requests** involves six steps:

1. Clarify the need for the change.
2. Formally log and document the change.
3. Evaluate the change and document its impact on the overall project scope, cost, schedule, and quality.
4. Get a decision on the proposed change from the appropriate authority (for example, steering committee, change control board, stakeholders, or sponsor).
5. If the change is approved, create a new baseline and update all project documentation.
6. Communicate to the team and impacted stakeholders.

### Earned Value Analysis

**Earned Value Analysis (EVA)** is a project management technique used to measure and evaluate project performance and progress in an objective manner. It integrates the **scope, schedule,** and **cost variables** to provide a comprehensive view of the project’s health. By comparing the planned work with the actual work completed and the costs incurred, EVA helps project managers identify variances in the project’s performance, enabling them to make informed decisions and take corrective actions if necessary.

The core metrics in Earned Value Analysis include **Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV),** and **Actual Cost (AC)**. PV represents the cumulative expected cost of the project over time, while EV measures the value of work actually performed based on the budget for that work. AC accounts for the actual costs incurred in completing the project work. By calculating variances and performance indices, such as Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Variance (SV), and Cost Performance Index (CPI), project managers can assess whether the project is on track, under or over budget, and ahead or behind schedule. These insights are crucial for predicting future performance trends and ensuring successful project delivery.

These metrics help project managers assess the current project performance and predict future performance trends to make informed decisions.

### Earned Value Analysis Variables

- **Planned Value (PV)**: The cumulative expected cost of the project over time.
- **Earned Value (EV)**: The measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget for that work.
- **Actual Cost (AC)**: The cumulative sum of costs incurred while actually accomplishing a project's work.
- **Cost Variance (CV)**: The difference between the earned value and the actual costs for the work completed to date. Formula: CV = EV – AC.
- **Schedule Variance (SV)**: The difference between the earned value and the planned value for the work completed to date. Formula: SV = EV – PV.
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: A ratio that determines whether the expenditure of resources is on track. Formula: CPI = EV / AC.
- **Budget at Completion (BAC)**: The total planned value of the project, representing the total budget allocated based on the initial project plan and scope. Formula: BAC = Total Planned Value (PV) of the project.
- **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**: A forecast of the total cost of a project based on its current progress. Formula: EAC = BAC / CPI.
- **Estimate to Complete (ETC)**: A metric used to predict the amount of cost or effort required to complete the remaining work on a project. Formula: ETC = EAC - AC.

The **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** is a financial performance metric used in project management to measure the cost efficiency of budgeted resources. It is calculated by dividing the **Earned Value (EV)** by the **Actual Cost (AC).** CPI is one of the essential findings of the Earned Value Management System as it informs the project management professional (PMP) of how far ahead of schedule or behind schedule the project is at the time of review.

If CPI > 1, it indicates that the project is under budget, while CPI < 1 indicates that the project is over budget. A CPI value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget.

- CPI can be used to evaluate if the project is on budget and provides a sense of how the cost is expended effectively. It can also assist a project manager to determine whether corrective action is needed.

When you divide the **total original planned value (PV)** of a project (**budget at completion [BAC]**) by the CPI, you can calculate a forecasted cost of the whole project by the time it will be complete. For example, if the project budget is US$10,000 and the CPI is 0.5 (meaning that you are either overspending or underperforming dramatically), then you can calculate an **estimate at completion (EAC)** for the whole project as follows: 

**Budget at Completion (BAC) Formula:**

- **Budget at Completion (BAC)** is the total planned value of the project. It represents the total budget allocated for the project, based on the initial project plan and scope. The BAC is used as a baseline to measure project performance and to compare the actual costs and earned value against the planned budget.
- BAC = Total Planned Value (PV) of the project

**Estimate at Completion (EAC) Formula:**

- **EAC (Estimate at Completion)** is a forecast of the total cost of a project based on its current progress. It is calculated by dividing the Budget at Completion (BAC) by the Cost Performance Index (CPI). The formula is:
- **EAC = BAC / CPI**

This metric helps project managers predict the final project cost, allowing for better budget management and decision-making.

**Estimate to Complete (ETC) Formula:**

- **Estimate to Complete (ETC)** is a metric used in project management to predict the amount of cost or effort required to complete the remaining work on a project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual costs incurred to date (AC) from the Estimate at Completion (EAC). The formula is:
- **ETC = EAC - AC**

This metric helps project managers to forecast the resources needed to finish the project and to assess if the project is on track in terms of budget and time.

> EAC = US$10,000 / 0.5 = US$20,000 In this case, you would say that you estimate the total cost of the project at completion to be US$20,000.
> 

When you subtract the actual cost (AC) of a project from the estimate at completion (EAC) that you calculated, you can derive the **estimate to complete (ETC)**, which is the amount of expense that the project is likely to need from the present point in the timeline to the time when it will be complete.

    - **Description**: A metric used to predict the amount of cost or effort required to complete the remaining work on a project.

## Planning

### Planning Performance Domain

The Planning Performance Domain encompasses the processes, activities, and tasks involved in developing and maintaining a project management plan. It includes defining the project scope, objectives, deliverables, and the detailed work needed to achieve them. The primary goal is to create a roadmap that guides the project team through the execution and control phases, ensuring that the project stays on track and meets its objectives.

Key components of the Planning Performance Domain include:

- **Scope Planning**: Defining the project's scope and ensuring all necessary work is included.
- **Schedule Planning**: Developing a schedule that outlines when and how project activities will be completed.
- **Cost Planning**: Estimating the costs involved and creating a budget.
- **Resource Planning**: Identifying and allocating the necessary resources, including personnel, equipment, and materials.
- **Risk Planning**: Identifying potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate them.
- **Quality Planning**: Establishing quality standards and procedures to ensure deliverables meet the required criteria.
- **Communication Planning**: Developing a plan for information dissemination and stakeholder engagement.
- **Procurement Planning**: Planning for the acquisition of goods and services from external sources.
- **Integration Planning**: Ensuring all aspects of the project are coordinated and work together effectively.

Effective planning is crucial for project success, as it provides a clear direction, aligns stakeholder expectations, and establishes a framework for monitoring and controlling project progress.

As we have discussed throughout this chapter, **planning predictive projects** follows a stepwise process:

1. **Decompose** the project scope into specific activities.
2. **Sequence** related activities.
3. **Estimate** the effort/work, people, and physical resources required to complete the activities and calculate the duration of each activity.
4. **Allocate** people and resources to the activities, based on availability.
5. **Adjust** the sequence, estimates, and resources until an agreed-upon schedule is achieved.

After completing step 5, if the schedule still does not meet the sponsor’s (or other stakeholders’) expectations, schedule compression techniques likely need to be applied. Two common approaches to schedule compression are used:

**Crashing**: This is a schedule compression method used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources in key activities along the critical path. 

**Fast tracking**: This is a schedule compression method in which some activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. 

- For example, once the specifications for network cabling are approved, cabling can begin, even though the specifications for the network server have still not been approved and are still in development. This is because cabling can usually be independent of the detailed specifications for a server, so the two tasks can be done in parallel.

To compress or modify a schedule, four types of dependencies among the project activities must be understood (see PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition, Section 2.4.2.3): 

**Mandatory dependency**: A relationship that is contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work. This type of dependency usually cannot be modified. 

**Discretionary dependency**: A relationship that is based on best practices or project preferences. This type of dependency may be modifiable. 

**External dependency:** A relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. This type of dependency usually cannot be modified. 

**Internal dependency**: A relationship between one or more project activities. This type of dependency may be modifiable.

**Scaling** in project management refers to the process of adjusting the size and complexity of project management practices and methodologies to fit the scope, resources, and needs of a specific project. This involves tailoring tools, processes, and techniques to ensure that they are appropriate for the project's size, complexity, and objectives. Scaling can mean simplifying practices for smaller projects or incorporating more comprehensive frameworks for larger, more complex projects.

# Problem-Solving Innovation

In a project environment, **creativity** is the ability to use one's imagination to come up with new and original ideas or things to meet requirements and/or solve problems.

In project management, creativity is the ability to think up ideas to produce something new through imaginative skills, whether a new solution to a problem, or a new method or device.

**Innovation** is the ability to solve the problem by converting an idea into reality, whether it is a product, service, or any form of deliverable for the client.

Although most people seem to believe that innovation is directly related to discoveries made by the R&D group, innovation also involves contributions made by all business functions of an organization (sales and marketing, finance, operations, etc.) toward the solution to a problem. Simply stated, innovation, as part of problem-solving, is a team effort.

---

## Creativity, Innovation and Value

Innovation is more than simply turning an idea into reality. It is a process that creates **value**. Whatever solution is arrived at must be recognized by the client as possessing value.

Some solutions to a problem may necessitate a reduction in value compared to the original requirements of the project. This is referred to as **negative innovation**. In such cases, innovation for a solution that reduces value can have a negative or destructive effect upon the team. People could see negative innovation as damage to their reputation and career.

If the innovation risks are too great, the project team may recommend some form of **open innovation**. Open innovation is a partnership with those outside your company by sharing the risks and rewards of the outcome. Many companies have creative ideas for solving problems but lack the innovative talent to implement a solution. Partnerships and joint ventures may be the final solution.

---

## Negative Innovation

Sometimes we start out a project with the best of intentions and later discover that some problem has occurred that could result in the cancellation of the project.

Rather than cancel the project outright, the solution might be to **downsize the project** and readjust our innovation attempts.

Factors that can lead to a readjustment in innovation include:

- The market for the deliverable has shrunk
- The deliverable will be overpriced, and demand will not be there
- The technical breakthrough cannot be achieved in a timely manner
- There is a loss of faith and enthusiasm by the team, and they no longer believe this solution is workable
- Possible loss of interest by top management and the client
- Insurmountable technical obstacles
- Significant decrease in the likelihood of success

If these factors exist, then it is entirely possible that another alternative must be selected in order to salvage the project.

---

## Types of Innovation

There are several types of innovation, and the three most common types are listed here. Each type comes with advantages and disadvantages.

1. **Product/quality improvements and cost reduction efforts**:  
   This type of innovation may be able to be accomplished quickly and with the existing resources in the company. The intent is to solve a problem and add incremental value to the end result.

2. **Radical breakthrough in technology**:  
   This type of innovation has risks. You may not be able to determine when the breakthrough will be made and the accompanying cost. Even if the breakthrough can be made, there is no guarantee that the client will receive added value from this solution. If the breakthrough cannot be made, the client may still be happy with the partial solution. This type of innovation may require the skills of only one or two people.

3. **Totally complex system or platform**:  
   This is the solution with the greatest risk. If the complex system cannot be developed, then the project will probably be considered as a total loss. A large number of highly talented resources are needed for this form of innovation.

## Attributes That are Difficult to Learn

There are courses on problem-solving and decision-making. Unfortunately, there are some attributes that excellent problem-solvers and decision-makers possess, and these cannot be taught easily in courses. The three most common attributes are:

- **Instinct**: The innate behavior that is the inherent inclination toward a particular type of behavior. It is an inborn pattern of behavior that is characteristic of a response to specific stimuli such as the desire to solve complex problems. It is often used with such words as a natural inclination, a natural or acquired tendency, aptitude, talent, knack, gift, capacity, genius, faculty, intuition, feeling, impulse, gut feeling, or sixth sense. People that have this instinct thrive on problem-solving. The more complex the problem, the greater their voluntary involvement.

- **Common sense**: Sound, practical judgment derived from experience rather than specialized knowledge. People that possess common sense tend to make decisions based upon the situation and the facts rather than based upon their technical knowledge. However, they may rely upon past experiences.

- **Guesswork**: The process of making guesses, or finding the conclusions arrived at by guessing. Guesswork is often used with other words such as conjecture, deduction, presumption, speculation, estimation, reasoning, approximation, and estimation. Guesswork is required when an estimate must be made and little or no information is available. Based upon the problem, guesswork may be the very first step when initiating problem-solving or decision-making sessions. Sometimes, guesswork is required simply to understand the problem.

## Creativity Roadblocks

There are also blockages to being creative. These include:

- Not understanding the problem well enough and attacking the wrong problem
- Making assessments and decisions too quickly
- Taking the first idea that is acceptable to the team
- Having a team that considers you as an outsider
- Having a team that refuses to support any of your ideas
- Having a team that has no faith in your ability to be part of the team

These roadblocks do not necessarily apply only to problem-solving that involves innovation. Also, the solution to some problems simply does not require innovation.

# Realistic Scheduling

A realistic schedule:

- Includes a detailed knowledge of the work to be done.
- Has task sequences in the correct order.
- Accounts for external constraints beyond the control of the team.
- Can be accomplished on time, given the availability of skilled people and enough equipment.
- Takes into consideration all the objectives of the project.

---

## Planning Overview

Here is a quick recap of the steps involved in planning a project. The first two actions prepare the groundwork for planning and can be considered **preplanning activities**. The remaining five steps develop the detailed plan.

## Preplanning Activities

- **Create the project definition:**  
  The project manager and the project team collaboratively develop the project charter. This document identifies the purpose, scope, and deliverables for the project, ensuring that everyone understands the project's objectives and boundaries. It also defines the responsibilities and roles of each team member.

- **Develop a risk management strategy:**  
  The project team evaluates likely obstacles and creates a strategy for managing risks, balancing costs, maintaining the schedule, and ensuring the scope is adhered to.

---

## Planning Steps

1. **Build a work breakdown structure (WBS):**  
   Identify all tasks required to build the specified deliverables.

2. **Identify task relationships:**  
   Place detailed tasks (work packages) in the proper sequence.

3. **Estimate work packages:**  
   Develop estimates that include labor, equipment, and duration for each task.

4. **Calculate initial schedule:**  
   Use estimates and task sequences to calculate total project duration.

5. **Assign and level resources:**  
   Adjust the schedule to optimize use of people and equipment.

These steps generate all the information required to understand how a project will be executed.

---

## Planning Step One: Build a Work Breakdown Structure

The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a detailed breakdown of all tasks required to complete the deliverables. It decomposes the project into smaller, manageable components called work packages.

**Steps to create a WBS:**

1. Identify major deliverables.
2. Decompose deliverables into smaller components.
3. Define work packages at the lowest level.
4. Assign unique identifiers.
5. Verify completeness.
6. Document the WBS for sharing.

A good WBS ensures nothing is overlooked and provides a clear roadmap for managing and executing the project.

---

## Planning Step Two: Identify Task Relationships

There are two basic rules for graphing task relationships in a network diagram:

- Define relationships only between **work packages**, not summary tasks.
- Task relationships should reflect sequence constraints, **not resource constraints**.

### Milestones

**Milestones** are useful markers that:

- Anchor the project start and finish.
- Mark external inputs or dependencies.
- Represent significant events not shown by a work package.

Milestones have zero duration but help with clarity.

### Task Relationship Types

- **Finish to Start (FS):** Task B starts after Task A finishes.
- **Start to Start (SS):** Task B starts after Task A starts.
- **Finish to Finish (FF):** Task B finishes after Task A finishes.

---

## Planning Step Three: Estimate Work Packages

Estimating work packages means determining labor, resources, and time.

### Key activities:

1. Estimate labor effort.
2. Estimate resource requirements.
3. Estimate duration.
4. Use estimation techniques (expert judgment, analogous, parametric, three-point).
5. Document estimates systematically.

### Cost Estimates come from:

1. **Labor:** Wages, benefits, overtime, indirect costs.
2. **Equipment:** Purchase/rental, maintenance, operation.
3. **Materials:** Raw materials, supplies, shipping, handling, storage.
4. **Subcontractors:** Fees for third-party work, extra expenses, coordination costs.

---

## Planning Step Four: Calculate Initial Schedule

Combine estimates and task relationships to build a timeline.

**Steps:**

1. **Sequence tasks:** Arrange logically.
2. **Develop a network diagram:** Visualize flow and identify dependencies.
3. **Identify the critical path:** Longest task sequence determining project duration.
4. **Calculate task start/finish dates:** Find earliest/latest possible timings.
5. **Create a Gantt chart:** Visual timeline of tasks.
6. **Review and adjust:** Align with team and stakeholder feedback.

---

## Planning Step Five: Assign and Level Resources

Ensure proper use of resources throughout the project.

**Steps:**

1. Assign resources to tasks.
2. Identify resource constraints.
3. Level resources to balance workload.
4. Manage resource allocation continuously.
5. Communicate with the team.

---

## The Process of Resource Leveling

Resources include people, equipment, and materials. Resource leveling focuses on people and equipment.

### Key aspects:

- Avoid over-allocation to prevent burnout and errors.
- Identify flexible tasks and adjust start/finish dates.
- Continuously monitor and adjust resource usage.
- Communicate clearly with the team.

Resource leveling maintains steady workflow, maximizes utilization, and creates a positive, sustainable work environment.

# Risk Management

**Risk management** is the means by which uncertainty is *systematically* managed to increase the likelihood of meeting project objectives. The key word is *systematically,* because the more disciplined the approach, the more we are able to control and reduce the risks. 

This chapter presents a framework for transforming the uncertainty inherent in projects into specific risks and developing strategies for managing them. 

One important concept in risk management is the distinction between "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns."

- **Known unknowns** are risks that we can identify and anticipate. We know that they could happen, but we do not yet know if they will happen or the extent of their impact. Examples might include potential regulatory changes or market fluctuations.
- **Unknown unknowns** are risks that we cannot foresee. These are events or conditions that we do not know about and therefore cannot plan for. These are often the most challenging risks to manage because they emerge unexpectedly.

**All project management is risk management** because every aspect of managing a project involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to achieve project objectives. Risk management is deeply integrated into every phase of a project, from initiation and planning to execution and closure.

1. **Planning**: During the planning phase, project managers must identify potential risks that could impact the project. This involves conducting risk assessments and creating risk management plans. By anticipating potential issues, managers can develop strategies to avoid or mitigate these risks.
2. **Scheduling and Budgeting**: Creating a project schedule and budget involves predicting future events and allocating resources accordingly. Any deviation from the plan, such as delays or cost overruns, represents a risk. Effective project managers continuously monitor these elements to ensure the project stays on track.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Allocating resources, including team members, equipment, and materials, involves assessing the availability and reliability of these resources. Any shortages or failures can pose significant risks to the project. Managers must develop contingency plans to address potential resource constraints.
4. **Stakeholder Management**: Engaging and managing stakeholders is crucial to project success. Miscommunication or misalignment with stakeholders' expectations can lead to risks. Project managers must ensure clear, consistent communication and manage stakeholder relationships to mitigate these risks.
5. **Execution and Monitoring**: During the execution phase, unforeseen events can arise, posing risks to the project's progress. Continuous monitoring and adapting to changing circumstances are essential to managing these risks effectively.
6. **Closing**: Even during the closing phase, risks such as incomplete deliverables or unmet objectives can arise. Ensuring thorough evaluation and documentation helps manage these potential risks.

From planning schedules and budgets to allocating resources and managing stakeholders, each step requires anticipating potential issues and developing strategies to address them. Effective risk management ensures that uncertainties are systematically managed, increasing the likelihood of project success.

### Business Risk vs. Project Risk

**Business Risk** refers to the potential for losses or negative impacts on an organization's overall operations, market position, or profitability. These risks are typically external and can affect the entire business. Examples include economic downturns, changes in regulatory environments, and competitive pressures.

**Project Risk**, on the other hand, is specific to a particular project and involves uncertainties that can impact the project's objectives, timeline, budget, or quality. These risks are usually internal and relate directly to the project’s scope, resources, and execution. Examples include technical failures, resource shortages, and schedule delays.

Understanding the distinction between business risk and project risk is crucial for effective risk management. While business risk affects the broader strategic direction of the organization, project risk is more focused on the successful delivery of individual projects.

### The Risk Management Framework

Figure 8.2 describes a risk management process that is repeated throughout the project:

- **Identify risks**: Systematically find all the factors that threaten project objectives.
- **Analyze and prioritize**: Assess each risk in terms of its possible damage and likelihood of occurrence. Most projects have an enormous number of potential risks. Quantifying the potential damage and the probability that a risk will occur enables the team to prioritize the risks, focusing their attention where it does the most good.
- **Develop a response**: Create strategies for reducing the possible damage and/or probability the risk will occur.
- **Establish reserves**: Set aside additional funding for the project that will be used in case specific risks occur—the known risks—as well as funding for the unknown risks.
- **Continuous Risk Management:** This involves ongoing monitoring and updating of the risk management process to adapt to new risks as they emerge, ensuring proactive management throughout the project lifecycle.

![Untitled](Untitled%2031.png)

### Breakdown of the Risk Management Framework

1. **Identify Risks**:
    - Thoroughly examine all possible factors that could threaten the achievement of project objectives.
    - Use various techniques such as **brainstorming, expert judgment,** and **checklists** to uncover potential risks.
    - Document all identified risks in a risk register for further analysis.
2. **Analyze and Prioritize**:
    - Evaluate each identified risk in terms of its potential impact on the project and the likelihood of its occurrence.
    - Use **qualitative** and **quantitative risk analysis techniques** to assess the severity of each risk.
    - **Categorize risks** based on their priority, focusing on the ones with the highest potential impact and likelihood.
3. **Develop a Response**:
    - Create specific strategies to address each prioritized risk.
    - Response strategies can include **risk avoidance, mitigation, transfer,** or **acceptance**.
    - Develop **contingency plans** for risks that cannot be entirely avoided or mitigated.
4. **Establish Reserves**:
    - Allocate additional funds and resources to handle identified risks, known as contingency reserves.
    - Set aside management reserves for unknown risks that may arise during the project.
    - Ensure that the reserves are accessible and can be deployed quickly when needed.
5. **Continuous Risk Management**:
    - Implement ongoing monitoring to detect new risks and changes in existing risks.
    - Regularly update the risk register and risk management plans to reflect the current risk landscape.
    - Conduct periodic risk reviews and audits to ensure that risk management processes are effective and up-to-date.

# Value Stream Management (VSM) and Continuous Discovery Delivery (CDD) in Project Management

## Introduction

In modern project management, especially under agile and lean paradigms, there is a strong emphasis on maximizing value delivery to customers and minimizing waste. **Value Stream Management (VSM)** and **Continuous Discovery and Delivery (CDD)** have emerged as key approaches toward this goal. VSM focuses on visualizing and optimizing the flow of value through all steps required to deliver a product or service, from concept to customer. CDD refers to integrating continuous product discovery (ongoing learning about user needs and validating ideas) with continuous delivery (frequently releasing incremental value), creating a tight feedback loop. This report provides an academic-style overview of VSM and CDD, covering their definitions, core principles, historical evolution in project management and agile/lean practices, supporting methodologies and tools, implementation considerations, a comparative analysis of the two, and real-world examples. The aim is to elucidate how each concept contributes to advanced project management and how together they can complement each other in practice.

## Value Stream Management (VSM)

### Definition and Core Principles

**Value Stream Management (VSM)** is an approach rooted in lean management that involves mapping, analyzing, and continuously improving the series of steps (the *value stream*) needed to deliver a product or service to the customer. A value stream encompasses **“the set of actions that take place to add value to a customer from the initial request through realization of value by the customer”** ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=A%20value%20stream%20is%20the,usually%20aligned%20with%20company%20processes)). In other words, it includes all activities (both value-adding and non-value-adding) from the conception of an idea to its final delivery and support. VSM builds on the technique of value-stream mapping, which is a lean method for analyzing the current state and designing an improved future state of the process that delivers a product/service ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Value,3)). The value stream map is a visual tool that displays all critical process steps and quantifies the time and resources at each stage ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Value,3)). By visualizing the flow of work, materials, and information, VSM helps teams identify waste (non-value-added activities) and delays in the process.

At its core, VSM is guided by key **lean principles**: focusing on *value* from the customer’s perspective, identifying and eliminating *waste* (`muda` in the Toyota Production System) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Daniel%20T,11)), ensuring continuous *flow* of value, allowing *pull* (work is pulled by customer demand or the next process step rather than pushed), and pursuing *perfection* through continuous improvement. The primary purpose of VSM is to increase efficiency and shorten delivery times by removing wasteful steps and optimizing necessary ones ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Value,across%20multiple%20processes)) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Although%20value,10)). Waste in this context can include anything from excess waiting and unnecessary handoffs to overproduction or defects ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=1.%20Faster,which%20results%20in%20greater%20lead)) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=6,resources%20required%20to%20correct%20them)). By categorizing activities into value-adding, non-value-adding, or necessary-but-non-value-adding, teams can target inefficiencies systematically ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Yasuhiro%20Monden%20,12)). Ultimately, VSM’s principle is *“focus on value”*, aligning with modern project management guidance such as PMI’s PMBOK, which emphasizes delivering valuable outcomes to stakeholders ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Although%20value,10)) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=,link)).

### Historical Background and Evolution

VSM has its origins in lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System of the mid-20th century. Toyota engineers developed techniques to map and manage material and information flows in production lines, aiming to eliminate waste and improve cycle times (a practice later called value-stream mapping) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Daniel%20T,11)). However, the term “value stream” and its formal mapping methodology gained wider recognition in the 1990s. A notable milestone was the publication of *Learning to See* by Mike Rother and John Shook in 1999, which provided practical guidance on value-stream mapping for identifying and eliminating muda (waste) in manufacturing processes ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=2.%20,8)). This period saw value-stream concepts become fundamental to *Lean Thinking*, and industries beyond automotive began adopting these ideas to improve efficiency.

By the early 2000s, the **lean principles** underpinning VSM started to influence software development and project management. Pioneers of lean software development (e.g., Mary and Tom Poppendieck) introduced the idea of viewing software processes through a lean lens, including mapping value streams of development activities. As lean and agile practices converged, value-stream mapping was increasingly applied to knowledge work and IT. Researchers and practitioners explored how to translate manufacturing-oriented VSM to software processes – for example, mapping the flow of requirements or code changes instead of physical materials. One challenge was that in software, much of the "work" is intangible and the “materials” are information; thus, the focus expanded to include the flow of information and communication necessary for development. Despite these differences, VSM proved useful in software and service contexts, as it could highlight wait times (e.g., work sitting in queues) and inefficiencies in workflows.

Through the 2010s, **agile and DevOps movements** accelerated the adoption of VSM in project and product delivery. Agile methodologies inherently value frequent delivery of working product, and DevOps emphasizes the smooth flow from development to operations – both goals that align with VSM. Organizations began using VSM to map their end-to-end software delivery pipelines (from ideation, through development and testing, to deployment and feedback). This helped break down silos between teams by visualizing how work moved through various departments. Notably, the practice of VSM in IT gained traction with concepts like **Lean IT** ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=ISBN%20%C2%A0%20104.%208.%20,ISBN%20%C2%A0%20107)) and publications such as *Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation* (2010) that applied lean management to information technology ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=ISBN%20%C2%A0%20104.%208.%20,ISBN%20%C2%A0%20107)). Large-scale agile frameworks also embedded value stream thinking; for instance, the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) introduced the identification of development value streams as a core step for scaling agile across enterprises ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=In%20modeling%20terms%2C%20those%20value,6)). By aligning agile release trains to value streams, SAFe acknowledges that organizing around the flow of value (rather than functional silos) is critical for effective delivery ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=In%20modeling%20terms%2C%20those%20value,6)).

In the late 2010s, the term **“Value Stream Management”** itself became prominent in the software industry. Analysts and tool vendors began referring to VSM as the next evolution of DevOps and Agile – extending beyond just mapping, to actively managing and measuring the flow from idea to production on an ongoing basis. For example, products and platforms appeared that offer end-to-end visibility of software workflows (integrating data from project tracking, CI/CD, and operations) to identify bottlenecks in real time. This shift was influenced by thought leaders like Mik Kersten, whose book *Project to Product* (2018) urged organizations to manage IT work as value streams rather than projects, introducing the “Flow Framework” with metrics (Flow Time, Flow Efficiency, etc.) to quantify value delivery. Thus, VSM evolved from a one-time mapping exercise to a continuous management practice. By the 2020s, **project management standards** also reflect these ideas: PMI’s PMBOK Guide (7th edition, 2021) stresses principles like focusing on value and systems thinking, implicitly encouraging techniques such as value stream mapping to optimize how projects deliver value ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Although%20value,10)). Today, VSM is applied not only in manufacturing but in logistics, healthcare, software development, product development, **project management**, and other domains to improve the efficiency of value delivery ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Although%20value,10)).

### Methodologies, Frameworks, and Tools Supporting VSM

VSM is supported by a variety of lean and agile methodologies, as well as specialized frameworks and tools:

- **Lean and Six Sigma:** The foundation of VSM lies in Lean methodology (originating from the Toyota Production System) which provides the *principles of waste reduction and flow*. Lean practitioners use VSM to identify the seven classic wastes (overproduction, waiting, transport, over-processing, inventory, motion, defects) and other inefficiencies in processes ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=1.%20Faster,which%20results%20in%20greater%20lead)) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=6,resources%20required%20to%20correct%20them)). Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma initiatives often incorporate VSM to visualize processes before analyzing variation and quality issues.
- **Agile and Scaled Agile Frameworks:** Agile methods advocate delivering incrementally and iteratively, which meshes well with VSM’s goal of continuous flow. Frameworks like **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)** formalize value streams at the program/portfolio level – distinguishing between *development value streams* (how new solutions are developed) and *operational value streams* (how the organization’s end customers receive value). SAFe’s focus on organizing around value and its concept of a continuous delivery pipeline align directly with VSM principles ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=In%20modeling%20terms%2C%20those%20value,6)). Other frameworks such as **DA (Disciplined Agile)** also encourage identifying value streams as part of tailoring lifecycle processes.
- **DevOps and Continuous Delivery Pipelines:** DevOps practices are essentially about removing constraints in the software delivery stream (e.g., automating steps, improving handoffs between dev and ops). The **deployment pipeline** concept in continuous delivery is a concrete implementation of a software value stream – including stages like build, test, deploy, release. Many DevOps teams use value-stream mapping to analyze their pipeline for delays (for instance, waiting for approvals or slow test cycles) and then apply automation or process changes to create a smoother flow. The lean concept of *poka-yoke* (error-proofing) is often applied via automated tests and checks in the pipeline ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=Continuous%20delivery%20treats%20the%20commonplace,can%20be%20marked%20as%20releasable)) ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=source%20control%20repository%2C%20then%20tested,can%20be%20marked%20as%20releasable)), ensuring quality as work flows through.
- **Kanban and Flow Frameworks:** Kanban (in agile) is a method that visualizes work and limits work-in-progress, directly supporting flow in a value stream. Teams using Kanban boards are effectively mapping part of their value stream (the development process) in real time and managing flow by addressing bottlenecks. Additionally, specialized frameworks like the **Flow Framework** (Kersten) introduced metrics and visualizations for software value streams, focusing on work item types (features, defects, risks, debt) and their flow through the system. These approaches come with tools that aggregate data from multiple sources (version control, ticketing, CI servers) to provide a dashboard of value stream health.
- **Process Mapping and Modeling Tools:** A variety of tools facilitate value stream mapping and management. Traditional VSM was often done with pen and paper or whiteboards during workshops, using standardized symbols for inventory, queues, transports, etc. ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=ImageValue,interpret%20the%20production%20system%20problems)). Today, software such as Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or specialized VSM tools allow creation of value stream maps digitally. More advanced **Value Stream Management Platforms** (offered by vendors like Tasktop (Planview), Plutora, ServiceNow, etc.) integrate with development toolchains to automatically map the flow of work from idea to release, measure key performance indicators (like lead time, cycle time, throughput), and highlight problem areas. These tools often support **analytics and simulation**: for example, running “what-if” scenarios on process changes or using simulation (as in academic research) to predict the impact of improvements ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=19.%20,27)). Furthermore, **business architecture tools** incorporate value streams as a modeling construct (tying them to capabilities and stakeholder value, as noted in enterprise architecture standards) ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=Value%20streams%20are%20artifacts%20within,user)) ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=In%20modeling%20terms%2C%20those%20value,6)).
- **Kaizen and Continuous Improvement Frameworks:** Implementing VSM is not a one-off task; it needs continuous improvement cycles. Methodologies like **Kaizen** (continuous incremental improvement) and **Kaikaku** (radical improvement) provide a cultural framework for regularly revisiting the value stream, measuring performance, and making enhancements. Many organizations establish cross-functional *value stream teams* or *communities of practice* that take ownership of monitoring the value stream performance and facilitating Kaizen events to drive ongoing refinement.

In summary, a wide ecosystem of frameworks and tools support VSM—from the conceptual (lean principles, agile frameworks) to the practical (mapping software, DevOps pipelines). The common thread is enabling teams to visualize work across the entire lifecycle and providing mechanisms to optimize flow and value delivery.

### Implementation in Practice (Organizational Considerations)

Implementing VSM in an organization involves both a **structured technique** and a **cultural shift**. On a practical level, the implementation often goes through these steps:

1. **Identify the Value Stream(s):** First, define the boundaries of the value stream to improve. In a project or product context, this could be *“idea to deployment”* for a software product, or *“customer request to fulfillment”* for a service. It’s crucial to begin with a clear understanding of what constitutes value to the end customer and which processes contribute to delivering that value.
2. **Map the Current State:** Bring together a cross-functional team (e.g., product managers, developers, testers, operations, business analysts, etc.) and map out the current sequence of activities in the value stream. This includes steps where value is added as well as delays, queues, handoffs, and feedback loops. The mapping should capture key data for each step, such as processing time, wait time, and quality metrics. By directly observing and charting the process, the team often uncovers surprising inefficiencies. (For example, a map might reveal that a feature spends weeks waiting for approval or testing, even though actual coding takes a few days.) A **current state map** provides a baseline and a shared understanding of how work currently flows ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20kinds%20of,3)).
3. **Identify Waste and Bottlenecks:** Analyze the current state map to pinpoint non-value-adding activities and problem areas. Common bottlenecks might include approval gates, handoff points between teams, batching of work causing delays, or rework due to quality issues. Teams will look for the 7 wastes in the context of their process (e.g., *Waiting* – work items sitting in a queue or backlog, *Extra processing* – unnecessary documentation or features, *Defects* – bugs causing rework). The data collected in the map (like average wait times) helps quantify these issues. This step often involves asking “why” repeatedly (root cause analysis) for each delay or waste observed.
4. **Design the Future State:** Next, the team envisions an improved process – the *future state value stream*. In this ideal future state, waste is reduced or eliminated and the flow is smoother. The future state design might include steps like combining or removing process steps, automating manual tasks (such as test or deployment processes), rearranging team responsibilities to reduce handoffs, implementing parallel work streams, or adding feedback loops earlier to catch issues sooner. Lean guidelines (like *single-piece flow*, or ensuring every step adds value for the customer) inform this design. The future state map thus becomes a target model that the organization will work towards ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20kinds%20of,3)).
5. **Implement and Iterate:** With the future state defined, the organization plans and executes the changes needed to achieve it. This could require project initiatives (e.g., adopting a CI/CD toolchain to enable automated deployments), policy changes (e.g., empowering teams to approve their own releases), or even structural changes (reorganizing teams around products/value streams rather than functions). During implementation, progress is tracked via metrics—commonly lead time (total time from idea to delivery), cycle times of individual stages, throughput of delivered value, and quality metrics. It’s important to treat this as an iterative process: after implementing changes, the team measures the new performance of the value stream, then possibly conducts another VSM session to find further improvements. In practice, many organizations institute *continuous improvement cadences* (like quarterly VSM workshops or monthly operational reviews) to keep refining the process.

Several **organizational considerations** are critical for successful VSM implementation:

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Because a value stream cuts across different functions (e.g., marketing, development, testing, operations in a software context), breaking down silos is essential. VSM efforts often bring representatives from all parts of the stream into the same room. This alignment helps create joint ownership of outcomes instead of a siloed “throw it over the wall” mentality.
- **Leadership Support and Culture:** VSM may recommend changes that challenge the status quo (for example, removing an approval step that a manager was responsible for, or investing in new tooling). Leadership must be on board to empower teams to make these changes and to emphasize that *improving the system as a whole* is more important than optimizing individual departments. A lean culture—where employees are encouraged to call out inefficiencies and suggest improvements, and where failing fast and learning is valued—greatly aids VSM. Management should communicate that the goal is to maximize customer value delivery, even if it means redefining roles or processes.
- **Aligning Around Value Streams:** Many organizations have reorganized team structures to align with product value streams as opposed to projects or functional groups. For instance, instead of separate departments for Analysis, Development, Testing, and Operations, an organization might form an *integrated product team* that includes all roles necessary to deliver value for a specific stream (like a specific product line or customer journey). This structural alignment ensures that the value stream has a dedicated team focused on throughput, often reducing handoffs and delays.
- **Training and Tools:** Teams often need training in lean/VSM techniques—learning how to identify waste, how to map processes, and how to interpret the maps. Specialist facilitation may be used initially (lean coaches or process improvement experts) to guide teams. On the tooling side, implementing supporting tools (digital Kanban boards, pipeline dashboards, etc.) helps sustain the practices. For example, using a Kanban board with work-in-progress limits can directly alleviate bottlenecks by preventing overload, reinforcing the improvements identified by VSM analysis.
- **Metrics and Feedback:** Adopting VSM goes hand-in-hand with tracking metrics that matter to value delivery. Key metrics include **lead time** (end-to-end), **cycle time** (for individual stages or work items), **throughput** (completed items per time), and **quality** (defect rates, customer satisfaction). Organizations should regularly review these metrics. Visual management is often employed – e.g., big screens or dashboards showing the flow metrics, so that any slowdown in the value stream is visible to everyone and can be acted upon. This creates a feedback loop where the performance of the value stream is continually monitored and improved, much like a control system.

Implementing VSM can face challenges such as resistance to change, difficulty in obtaining accurate data for mapping, or sustaining momentum after initial improvements. Successful cases often cite that making the process improvement effort *collaborative* (so everyone sees the benefit) and *incremental* (tackling biggest pain points first) helps overcome these issues. Over time, as VSM becomes ingrained, organizations may find that they can respond faster to customer needs because the internal machinery of delivery is optimized for flow.

### Real-World Examples of VSM

VSM’s impact is well-documented in both manufacturing and knowledge work. A classic example from manufacturing is **Toyota**, where these techniques originated; Toyota’s relentless focus on streamlining every step between order and delivery allowed it to drastically reduce production times and outcompete rivals – this is essentially VSM in action within the factory. But beyond such well-known cases, there are many instances in product development and IT:

- **Software Product Development (Ericsson Case):** A case study at Ericsson AB (a large telecom company) applied value stream mapping in the early phases of software product development. The practitioners mapped out not only the flow of work artifacts (requirements, design, code) but also the flow of information and communication between teams. By using an approach called FLOW-assisted VSM, they uncovered that many delays were caused by information bottlenecks – teams waiting on clarifications or approvals. After implementing changes to improve information flow (such as better documentation standards and communication channels), the case study reported positive outcomes. The combination of VSM and the FLOW modeling systematically exposed issues and characterized solutions, proving *“practically useful for waste removal”* and improving software quality in the process. In this example, VSM provided a clear direction for process improvements (like reducing wait times for reviews) which led to faster and more predictable delivery for Ericsson’s product development unit.
- **Financial Services (Banking) Example:** Large banks have used VSM during agile transformations to reduce the time to release new features to customers. For instance, one multinational bank mapped its software delivery process for mobile banking features. The current state map revealed that a request for a new feature took over 6 months to go live, with major delays in upfront analysis and later in integration testing. By re-organizing teams into cross-functional squads aligned to specific customer journeys (value streams) and introducing automated testing pipelines, the bank was able to cut the lead time dramatically. While specific figures are proprietary, such transformations often report lead time reductions on the order of 30–50% and improved frequency of releases. (This example is anecdotal but reflects patterns reported at industry conferences and lean case studies.)
- **Healthcare Service Improvement:** In a hospital context, VSM has been used to improve patient discharge processes. A hospital identified the value stream from a patient finishing treatment to being discharged home, which involved multiple departments (nursing, pharmacy, billing, etc.). The VSM exercise found redundancies and waiting periods (e.g., patients waiting for final paperwork or medications). By streamlining tasks in parallel and clarifying responsibilities (a future state with a “discharge coordinator” role was implemented), the hospital reduced average discharge time and increased patient satisfaction. This cross-industry example shows the versatility of VSM in any process-heavy project.
- **Scaled Agile in Engineering (SAFe implementation at Airbus):** Airbus, the aerospace company, publicly shared how they adopted SAFe and lean practices to speed up development of aviation software. A part of their approach was to identify value streams for different product lines (like a flight management system software). By doing so, they could launch agile release trains that were responsible for the end-to-end delivery in that stream. They used VSM to pinpoint where traditional engineering phases had bottlenecks and then introduced concurrent workflows and automated testing to remove those. The result was a significant improvement in coordination among teams and reduction in time-to-market for certain avionics software updates. While not labeled as “VSM” in their report, the practice of mapping and managing value flow was integral to their agile transformation.

These examples illustrate that VSM, when applied, often leads to tangible improvements: shorter delivery times, fewer handoffs (or smoother handoffs), clarity in roles, and better quality due to early identification of issues. Moreover, they highlight that **VSM is not limited to manufacturing – it is being successfully employed in software and service industries** ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Although%20value,10)). By continuously managing the value stream, organizations ensure that project management is not just about delivering on time and scope, but about delivering maximum *value* in the fastest, most efficient way.

## Continuous Discovery and Delivery (CDD)

### Definition and Core Principles

**Continuous Discovery and Delivery (CDD)** refers to the integrated practice of continuously exploring customer needs and opportunities (continuous discovery) while continuously delivering solutions through rapid, iterative development (continuous delivery). In essence, it combines two complementary facets of modern product management: discovering *what* to build and then quickly building and releasing it in small increments.

- **Continuous Discovery:** This is the ongoing process of generating ideas, uncovering user problems, testing assumptions, and validating potential solutions **in a continuous cadence throughout the project/product lifecycle**. Rather than treating product discovery as a one-time phase (e.g., doing all requirements research upfront), continuous discovery means the team keeps learning and adapting as they go. Core principles of continuous discovery include a **customer-centric approach** (frequent engagement with users and stakeholders to gather feedback), **hypothesis-driven development** (framing ideas as hypotheses and running experiments to prove or disprove them), and **fast feedback loops** (using prototypes, interviews, and A/B tests to quickly learn what works). The goal is to ensure the team is always building the *right* thing – the product features or enhancements that truly solve user problems and deliver value. Thought leaders like Marty Cagan and Teresa Torres have championed that product teams should be doing discovery work continuously (e.g. weekly customer touch points, continuous experimentation) to inform their delivery ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D)). Continuous discovery often manifests as **“dual-track agile”** – where one track of team activity is exploring and validating ideas (discovery) just ahead of the other track that is building and shipping product (delivery).
- **Continuous Delivery:** This is a software engineering practice in which code changes are **integrated, tested, and prepared for release to production on a continuous basis**. Teams practicing continuous delivery aim to have a deployment-ready build at all times, enabling release of new code to users frequently (from daily to even on every commit) ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=Continuous%20delivery%20,is%20important%20for%20continuous%20delivery)). According to one definition, *“Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time”* ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=Continuous%20delivery%20,is%20important%20for%20continuous%20delivery)). The core principles of continuous delivery include **automation of the software pipeline** (build, test, deployment processes are highly automated), **small batch sizes** (making many small changes rather than infrequent large releases), and **continuous integration of code** (developers merge their work frequently to avoid integration hell). This approach reduces risk and delivers value faster by enabling incremental updates to applications ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=produce%20software%20in%20short%20cycles%2C,is%20important%20for%20continuous%20delivery)). Key components often cited are *visibility*, *feedback*, and *continuous deployment*: all aspects of the pipeline are visible to the team, feedback on changes (via tests or monitoring) is rapid, and the process is set up so that deploying any approved build to any environment is push-button (or fully automatic) ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=Continuous%20delivery%20is%20enabled%20through,7)). In summary, continuous delivery ensures the team is always ready to deliver the *product increments* that continuous discovery has determined to be valuable.

When combined as **Continuous Discovery & Delivery (CDD)**, the philosophy is that a high-performing team *continuously does the right research and continuously delivers the right product*. The interplay between the two is crucial: **discovery feeds a validated backlog for delivery**, and **delivery provides real user feedback to inform further discovery**. Some key principles that emerge from this integrated approach are:

- **Customer Value Focus:** CDD keeps the focus on customer value at all times. Discovery ensures the team is tackling problems worth solving (avoiding wasteful development of features no one wants), and delivery gets those solutions to customers quickly to realize the value. This reflects the agile principle of valuing customer collaboration and satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- **Fast Feedback Loops End-to-End:** Not only does each side (discovery, delivery) have its own feedback loop, but together they form a larger loop: an idea is conceived and prototyped, user feedback is gathered (maybe through a user test or an MVP release), then the idea is refined and built, then actual usage data is collected from the live product, which feeds into new ideas. The cycle of **Build–Measure–Learn**, popularized by Lean Startup, is essentially the engine of CDD ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=,Toggle%20Business%20model%20templates)). A continuous discovery mindset means measuring and learning are constant, and a continuous delivery pipeline means building and deploying can happen on demand.
- **Iterative and Incremental Approach:** CDD embraces that neither requirements nor implementations are fully known upfront. By iterating in small steps, teams can adjust course as they learn. Continuous discovery might start with a minimum viable product (MVP) or even a simulation of a service to gauge interest, which continuous delivery then turns into a real, albeit minimal, product increment. Then through many incremental improvements guided by ongoing discovery, the product evolves. This avoids the waterfall-era pitfalls of big design upfront or long release cycles with no user input in between.
- **Collaboration and Cross-Functional Teams:** Just as VSM necessitates cross-functional work, CDD relies on close collaboration between roles like product managers, UX designers, and engineers. In fact, in a continuous discovery and delivery model, the lines between these activities blur: engineers might join customer interviews or analyze user data (discovery activities), and designers might pair with developers to ensure what’s built meets the discovered needs. Many organizations implementing CDD form *Product Trios* (product, design, engineering leads) that collectively own both discovery and delivery for their area, working together constantly. Silos between “the people who decide what to build” and “the people who build it” are removed.
- **Tools and Automation for Speed:** A principle of CDD is that nothing should slow down the loop more than necessary. On the discovery side, this leads to techniques like rapid prototyping, lightweight experimentation (e.g., Wizard-of-Oz tests, fake-door tests) to get answers quickly without over-investment. On the delivery side, heavy automation is used to ensure that once something is validated, it can be coded, tested, and released rapidly. Continuous integration servers, automated test suites, and one-click deployments are standard practices that embody this principle. The net effect is a smoothly running idea-to-production conveyor belt, with minimal friction at each step.

In summary, **Continuous Discovery and Delivery** is about continuously doing the *right work* (discovery of value) and doing the work *right* (delivery with high quality and speed). The convergence of these principles addresses both effectiveness (building what users need) and efficiency (fast, reliable releases). It’s a response to the complex, fast-changing environment of today’s projects: teams stay adaptive and user-focused from start to finish.

### Historical Background and Evolution

The evolution of CDD can be traced through the separate histories of “discovery” practices and “delivery” practices, which in recent years have converged:

- **Early Software Development Paradigms:** In the traditional waterfall model of project management, **requirements discovery** was a phase at the beginning – extensive research, requirement documents, and sign-offs happened before implementation. Delivery then occurred much later as a big bang. This separation often led to products that missed the mark, because by the time the product was delivered, the market or user needs may have changed, or initial assumptions proved wrong. Dissatisfaction with this outcome was one of the drivers for the Agile movement in the 1990s and early 2000s, which sought to shorten the cycle.
- **Agile and the Need for Continuous Discovery:** Agile methodologies (like Scrum, XP) dramatically shortened delivery cycles to a few weeks, enabling *continuous delivery of increments*. However, in early agile implementations, the notion of discovery was not explicitly detailed – many teams still treated the product backlog as given by a Product Owner, with limited guidance on how that backlog gets continually refreshed with the best ideas. Over time, practitioners realized that to fully realize agility, the *product discovery process itself must also be agile*. Around the mid-2000s, techniques like **user story mapping** (by Jeff Patton) and **agile UX** emerged, allowing teams to integrate user research and idea validation into each iteration. The term **“dual-track agile”** was coined to describe having one track for discovery and one for delivery in parallel, an idea reported in industry circles by the late 2000s. Marty Cagan, in his book *Inspired* (first published 2008), stressed the importance of product discovery alongside delivery to build successful products, giving many real-world examples of how tech companies iterate on both understanding the problem and implementing the solution.
- **Lean Startup and Continuous Experimentation:** A significant influence on continuous discovery was the **Lean Startup movement** (Eric Ries, circa 2011). Lean Startup provided a framework for continuous learning through the **Build-Measure-Learn** loop, advocating that even in large projects, one should start with hypotheses and test them with minimal viable products (MVPs) and iterate based on feedback ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=,Toggle%20Business%20model%20templates)). Concepts like **continuous deployment** (deploying code immediately and often) were popularized around this time – Ries noted startups he worked with were deploying to production dozens of times a day to test ideas ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=Continuous%20deployment%2C%20similar%20to%20continuous,20)) ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=,20)). Lean Startup influenced many established organizations to adopt a more experimental approach to product development, essentially sowing the seeds for continuous discovery by making experimentation mainstream. In parallel, **Design Thinking** (which predates lean startup but saw a resurgence in 2000s) emphasized empathy with users and iterative prototyping – bridging to agile via processes like Google Ventures’ Design Sprint (a one-week intensive discovery sprint). All these trends moved the culture toward *continuous validation* of ideas, not just at project start but throughout.
- **Continuous Delivery and DevOps:** On the delivery side, a key milestone was the publication of the book *Continuous Delivery* by Jez Humble and David Farley in 2010, which systematically described the techniques and mindset for being able to release software at any time. Around the same time, the **DevOps movement** gained momentum (the first DevOps Day was 2009), breaking down the wall between development and IT operations to enable faster, more reliable deployments. Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and later cloud-based CI/CD services emerged to facilitate continuous integration and automated deployment. By the mid-2010s, high-profile tech companies demonstrated that **continuous deployment** (automating the release of every change that passes tests) was feasible at scale – Amazon, Netflix, and others shared stories of deploying hundreds or thousands of times per day. This represented the maturation of continuous delivery practices. Research such as the *State of DevOps* reports and the book *Accelerate* (2018) by Nicole Forsgren et al. scientifically showed that continuous delivery capabilities (e.g., high deploy frequency, low lead time) correlate with better business outcomes, further encouraging adoption. Thus, by late 2010s, continuous delivery was no longer a niche practice but a goal for many organizations' IT and project teams ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=released%20at%20any%20time.,is%20important%20for%20continuous%20delivery)) ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=software%20with%20greater%20speed%20and,is%20important%20for%20continuous%20delivery)).
- **Convergence – Product Teams and DevOps Fusion:** As both discovery and delivery practices matured, forward-thinking organizations started merging them into a seamless process. This was evident in companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, which pioneered *data-driven product development*: they continuously experiment (discovery through A/B testing) and have infrastructure to roll out changes immediately (continuous delivery). A famous quote by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos highlights this ethos: *“Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.”* ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D)). This “experimentation culture” essentially equates to continuous discovery being a core strategy, made possible by continuous delivery of test features. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg similarly noted that at any time Facebook is running thousands of different test versions, indicating a massive scale of concurrent discovery experiments ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D)). By the late 2010s, many product organizations restructured into durable, cross-functional **product teams** responsible for specific outcomes, not just outputs. These teams were tasked with both discovering what to build (through user research, metrics, experiments) and delivering it (through agile development and DevOps). The line between project management and product management blurred as the focus shifted to continuous delivery of value, guided by continuous discovery.
- **Formalization of Continuous Discovery:** The term **“Continuous Discovery”** as a distinct concept gained popularity in the late 2010s, largely due to product thought leaders like Teresa Torres. Around 2017–2018, Torres began sharing a framework for continuous discovery, advocating for weekly customer interviews and iterative assumption testing. By 2021, she published *Continuous Discovery Habits*, which provided practical techniques for teams to implement discovery on an ongoing basis (e.g., Opportunity Solution Trees for mapping hypotheses to experiments). This has led to more teams explicitly tracking discovery activities as part of their workflow (some agile teams now have dual backlogs – one for discovery tasks and one for delivery tasks, continually maintained). Meanwhile, agile scaling frameworks incorporated similar ideas: **SAFe** introduced the concept of *Continuous Exploration* as part of its Agile Product Delivery competency, acknowledging that identifying what customers need is a continuous effort parallel to continuous integration and continuous deployment. SAFe’s “continuous delivery pipeline” includes *Continuous Exploration -> Continuous Integration -> Continuous Deployment -> Release on Demand*, which is effectively a model of CDD in a larger enterprise context.

In summary, by the 2020s the industry has gravitated towards uniting discovery and delivery. Historically separate threads (product management vs. project execution, requirements vs. implementation) have intertwined. This evolution is driven by the realization that to be competitive and responsive, organizations must constantly learn **and** constantly deliver. Project management in an agile enterprise thus increasingly means managing a pipeline of hypotheses and experiments as well as managing sprints and releases. The convergence of these practices is an ongoing journey – many organizations are still working through how to fully integrate them – but the trend and its benefits are well recognized in advanced project management thinking.

### Key Methodologies, Frameworks, and Tools Supporting CDD

Implementing continuous discovery and continuous delivery involves a mix of methodologies from the product management, design, and software engineering realms. Below are some of the key frameworks and tools that support CDD:

- **Lean Startup and Agile Experimentation:** The Lean Startup methodology (Build-Measure-Learn cycle) is a cornerstone for continuous discovery. Teams often adopt lean startup techniques such as formulating hypotheses, defining MVPs, and running experiments to validate learning quickly ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=,Toggle%20Business%20model%20templates)). For example, techniques like **A/B testing** (split testing) allow teams to try out two variants of a feature simultaneously to see which performs better ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=)) ([Lean startup - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#:~:text=A%20split%20or%20A%2FB%20test,version%20on%20an%20actionable%20metric)). This is heavily used to continuously discover user preferences and optimize features (e.g., testing two layouts of a page to see which yields more engagement). Tools like Optimizely, Google Optimize, or in-house experimentation platforms facilitate this by splitting traffic and collecting metrics. Similarly, **feature flags (toggles)** are used in code to turn on/off features for subsets of users, enabling controlled experiments or gradual rollouts.
- **Design Thinking and User-Centered Design:** Continuous discovery borrows from design thinking, which provides methods for empathizing with users, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. Techniques such as **user interviews**, **observational studies**, and **journey mapping** are conducted continuously (not just at project outset) to feed insights. **Design sprints**, initially a week-long process, can be adapted into ongoing mini-cycles where a team continuously prototypes and tests parts of the product. Tools like Figma, Sketch, or InVision allow rapid prototyping of interface ideas to test with users before development. UX research tools (UserTesting, etc.) and feedback collection platforms (like Intercom, UserVoice for capturing user feedback or pain points) create a steady stream of discovery data. In practice, teams maintain an evolving repository of user needs and pain points and revisit it frequently to reprioritize what to tackle next.
- **Dual-Track (Discovery/Delivery) Agile Framework:** While not a formal “framework” like Scrum, the dual-track agile approach has been embraced by many teams as a way to organize continuous discovery alongside delivery. Typically, such a team timeboxes regular discovery activities within each sprint or runs a staggered schedule (e.g., discovery work on upcoming features is always one sprint ahead of development work). Some teams use Kanban for the discovery track (since research and ideation can be continuous flow) and Scrum for the delivery track, or vice versa. The **Opportunity Solution Tree** (from Torres) is a visual tool that maps out discovered user opportunities, possible solutions, and experiments, helping teams decide where to focus next discovery efforts and which solutions to validate and deliver. **Story Mapping** (by Jeff Patton) is another technique to visualize the user journey and backlog, ensuring continuous conversation about what to build next based on user value. Agile practitioners often integrate these techniques with backlog refinement sessions; for example, a team might have a weekly “discovery meeting” to review experiment results and adjust the backlog priorities accordingly.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline Tools:** On the delivery side, a host of tools support the technical implementation of continuous delivery. Version control systems (like Git) combined with continuous integration servers (Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) allow every code change to be built and tested automatically. Test automation frameworks (JUnit, Selenium, Cypress, etc. for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests) are essential to ensure that continuous delivery does not compromise quality – tests become the safety net enabling rapid releases. Containerization and cloud infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes) have further eased continuous deployment by standardizing environments and enabling quick rollbacks or roll-forwards of services. Infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, Ansible) let teams version and automate environment setup, which is crucial for reproducibility across dev, test, and prod deployments. **Monitoring and observability tools** (like New Relic, DataDog, Splunk) then close the loop by providing real-time feedback from production about the behavior of new releases, which is invaluable for discovery (e.g., seeing usage patterns, error rates, etc. of newly delivered features). The widespread availability of these tools by the 2010s made continuous delivery feasible for even smaller teams.
- **DevOps and Cloud Services:** Many organizations leverage cloud services which naturally support continuous delivery. Platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP provide pipeline services (AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, Google Cloud Build) and managed deploy services (like AWS CodeDeploy or Azure release pipelines) that integrate with code repositories to automate build/test/deploy. They also enable practices like **blue-green deployments** or **canary releases** (deploying new versions to a small percentage of users before full rollout), which align with continuous discovery by enabling experimentation in production with limited risk. The DevOps culture, which emphasizes automation, measurement, sharing, and a blameless approach to failure, underpins CDD by ensuring the team continuously improves both the product and the process.
- **Metrics and Analytics Frameworks:** Continuous discovery relies on data to validate whether delivered features are actually delivering the expected value. Product analytics tools (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude) allow teams to instrument their applications and get immediate insights into how users are interacting with new features. Teams set up **key performance indicators (KPIs)** or **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** for their product (for example, conversion rate, retention, task completion time) and monitor these as new enhancements are delivered. If metrics move in the wrong direction or not at all, that triggers further discovery (why did this feature not have the intended impact?). In essence, analytics tools serve as a compass for continuous discovery by quantifying the results of delivered increments.
- **Frameworks for Scaled Continuous Delivery:** For organizations running multiple teams, frameworks like **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)** provide structure for CDD at scale. SAFe’s notion of *Continual Exploration* (CE) aligns with continuous discovery – it involves constantly exploring market needs, customer feedback, and technology options. CE feeds into continuous integration and deployment by generating a backlog of validated features for teams to implement. Another scaled approach is **OKR-driven Agile**, where company objectives encourage teams to continuously experiment (discovery) and iterate (delivery) towards measurable outcomes each quarter. By tying outcomes to experiments, teams are implicitly running CDD cycles to achieve their OKRs.

Overall, the toolkit for CDD is rich: it spans **ideation tools and techniques (for discovery)** and **engineering pipelines (for delivery)**. Importantly, organizations implementing CDD need to integrate these toolsets. For instance, experiment results (from an A/B testing platform) should feed into the product backlog (managed in Jira or similar), and user feedback from support channels might be triaged alongside automated test results from CI. Achieving this integration often requires process discipline and sometimes custom integration (connecting analytics dashboards to planning tools). Many teams also adopt **cadence meetings** like weekly product reviews (to look at discovery findings and delivery progress together) or daily standups that include both discovery and delivery tasks, ensuring the two tracks remain synchronized.

### Implementing CDD in Practice (Organizational Considerations)

Implementing continuous discovery and delivery requires changes in team structure, culture, and day-to-day processes. Here’s how organizations put CDD into practice, along with considerations to make it successful:

- **Product-Oriented Team Structure:** Transition from project-based teams (formed around a project and disbanded after completion) to persistent *product teams* or *feature teams*. Each team is responsible for an ongoing product area or value stream and includes members with all the skills necessary to both discover and deliver (e.g., product manager, designers, engineers, QA, data analysts). This long-lived team structure supports continuous discovery because the team stays with the product, gains deep customer understanding over time, and always has a next set of hypotheses to test. It also aligns with continuous delivery because the team owns their deployment pipeline and can release whenever ready, rather than waiting for a separate release team.
- **Embedding Discovery in Team Rituals:** Teams practicing CDD explicitly allocate time for discovery activities in every iteration. For instance, a team might set a goal like “talk to at least 5 customers or end-users each week” or “run one experiment every sprint.” This could be achieved by scheduling regular user interviews or usability tests on the calendar. Some teams adopt a *cadence* such as: Monday for planning and reviewing last week’s experiment results, Tuesday-Thursday for execution (development and ongoing discovery tasks), Friday for user testing and delivery of completed work. Integrating these into the agile ceremonies (e.g., in Scrum, including a brief discussion of discovery tasks during stand-up, or reviewing experiment outcomes in the sprint review along with delivered features) normalizes discovery as part of the process, not an ad-hoc activity.
- **Backlog Management and Dual-Track Flow:** In practical terms, teams manage two streams of work that feed into each other. A **Discovery Backlog** contains questions to answer, customer problems to explore, and hypotheses to test. A **Delivery Backlog** contains refined user stories or tasks ready for implementation. A common workflow is: ideas start in the discovery backlog where they are fleshed out via research or prototyping; if an idea is validated or highly promising, it then moves into the delivery backlog as a well-defined item to build. For example, a discovery item might be “Test if users would use a mobile app feature to do X”, and the team might do a quick prototype and show it to 5 users. If feedback is positive, they create official user stories and acceptance criteria for the feature and schedule it in an upcoming sprint. Project managers or product owners ensure that the discovery and delivery backlogs are kept aligned with overall project/product goals. They also ensure that developers are not idle if discovery takes longer than expected, and conversely that discovery isn’t neglected when the team is busy delivering—balancing the two tracks is an art that improves with practice.
- **Empowered Teams and Decentralized Decision-Making:** Continuous discovery requires that teams can rapidly make product decisions (like pivoting on a feature based on user feedback) without bureaucratic delays. This means leadership must empower teams to act on the insights they gather, within guardrails. Many organizations implement *product empowerment* – the team is given a clear objective or outcome to achieve (say, improve user retention by X%), and they have autonomy to experiment and implement ideas to reach that outcome. Management provides strategic direction and support but does not micromanage the feature scope. This autonomy is essential so that the cycle of discovery and delivery can spin quickly. If every experiment or feature needs lengthy approval, it breaks the continuous aspect. Thus, trust in teams and a shift to outcome-based evaluation (rather than output-based) is a key cultural change for CDD.
- **Risk Management and Governance:** Traditional project management might worry that continuous experimentation is risky or that continuous delivery could lead to instability. In CDD, risk is managed in new ways: small experiments and MVPs actually reduce the risk of big failures by testing ideas cheaply. Continuous delivery reduces release risk by doing it more often (counterintuitively, frequent small releases have less risk than infrequent big ones, because problems are caught early and rollback scope is small). To satisfy governance, organizations define safety nets and guardrails. For discovery, there may be policies on experiment ethics (e.g., not misleading users heavily in fake-door tests, or obtaining consent for beta features) and on how to decide when an experiment result justifies changing direction. For delivery, robust engineering practices (test coverage, monitoring, feature flag kill-switches) act as insurance. Some regulated industries use *ring-fenced sandbox environments* to test features with real data before full release. The continuous approach can coexist with governance by demonstrating that each increment is controlled and reviewed. In fact, many PMOs (Project Management Offices) have started to adapt, focusing on *continuous value assurance* rather than checklist stage gates.
- **Customer Involvement and Feedback Loops:** Organizations often create formal programs to facilitate continuous user engagement. This might include maintaining a panel of beta testers or key customers who agree to provide frequent feedback, using analytics dashboards to watch user behavior daily, or setting up community forums. For instance, some software teams have “feedback Fridays” where they reach out to a few users who recently started or stopped using a feature to learn why. The idea is to treat user feedback as an ongoing stream of data that guides the project, equal in importance to internal reports. Project managers might incorporate customer feedback metrics into their status reports (for example, “this quarter we ran 10 experiments, 4 of which showed positive impact, 3 negative, 3 inconclusive – here’s what we learned and how it affected the roadmap”). This represents a shift from traditional reporting (scope, schedule, budget) to include *learning metrics* and *outcome metrics*.
- **Technical Excellence and Automation:** To truly achieve continuous delivery, teams often need to invest significantly in their engineering infrastructure. This might mean refactoring a monolithic application into a microservices architecture so that parts of the system can be deployed independently without impacting others, or writing thousands of automated tests to cover critical business paths so that deployments can be confident. Technical debt is managed proactively; if poor code quality slows down releases, the team allots time to fix it because it directly hampers their ability to deliver continuously. Build times and test times are monitored—if the build starts taking 2 hours, that’s an impediment to rapid iteration, so engineers will spend time optimizing it (like parallelizing tests or upgrading hardware). Such continuous attention to engineering capability is a hallmark of organizations that successfully implement continuous delivery. Cloud and DevOps practices such as **infrastructure as code**, **continuous monitoring**, and **chaos engineering** (injecting failure to test resilience) might be employed to ensure the pipeline and product can handle constant change.
- **Cultural Mindset – Learning Over Failure:** For continuous discovery especially, the culture must celebrate learning, not penalize failed experiments. If team members fear punishment for an idea that didn’t pan out, they will avoid bold experiments – undermining the whole point of discovery. Many organizations address this by reframing “failure” as “learning,” publicizing lessons from experiments, and even tracking “pivoted based on insight” as a positive metric. Leadership can reinforce this by sharing stories of when an early assumption was wrong but continuous discovery caught it in time to change course (as opposed to delivering a failed project). This learning culture ties closely with the lean startup mantra of *validated learning* as a unit of progress, and it gives teams confidence to iterate rapidly.

Implementing CDD can be challenging – it demands a high level of team maturity and alignment. Common challenges include: ensuring the discovery track produces validated ideas at a pace that keeps the delivery team busy (not idle), avoiding burnout when trying to do “double work” (one way to mitigate is to rotate team members – e.g., a subset focuses on discovery for a week while others focus on delivery, then swap), and integrating with organizational constraints (like fixed-date commitments or client expectations – which can still be met, but require transparency that CDD will evolve the solution on the way). However, when done well, CDD can supercharge a project’s success rate by ensuring **the right product is built right**, and it can drastically cut wasted effort on features that would have failed by exposing that early through discovery.

### Real-World Examples of CDD

Many leading companies have embraced aspects of continuous discovery and delivery, often sharing their approaches publicly. Here are a few illustrative examples and case studies:

- **Amazon’s Experimentation and Delivery Culture:** Amazon is often cited for its relentless experimentation and high deployment frequency. Jeff Bezos’s quote that *“Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day”* ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D))reflects a top-down encouragement of continuous discovery. Practically, Amazon allows teams (organized as “two-pizza teams”) to deploy independent services whenever ready – it was reported that Amazon deployed code to production on average every 11.7 seconds in 2011 (all those micro deployments enabling constant improvement). One concrete example is Amazon’s A/B testing of the Prime signup flow or product recommendations: they continuously test variations in real time and immediately scale up the winners. On the discovery side, Amazon is known for its “working backwards” approach where product teams start by writing an internal press release and FAQ for the hypothetical product, focusing on customer benefits, and then iteratively prototype – essentially continuously refining the idea before heavy investment. Meanwhile, their delivery pipeline (with tools like AWS CodePipeline internally) means that once a feature is that once a feature is validated through an experiment or prototype, it can be swiftly rolled out and iterated upon. This combination of bold experimenting (discovery) and rapid, automated deployment (delivery) is a hallmark of Amazon’s approach.
- **Facebook’s Continuous Experimentation:** Facebook’s product development similarly embodies CDD. Mark Zuckerberg noted that *“At any given point in time, there isn’t just one version of Facebook running. There are probably 10,000.”* ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D)) – referring to the thousands of A/B tests and feature experiments running concurrently on the platform. Facebook has built a sophisticated framework to deploy code changes to small user samples, measure their impact on engagement, performance, etc., and then gradually scale or revert. Engineering teams at Facebook deploy updates frequently (often daily), using feature flags to control the rollout. If an experiment shows negative results or a new feature causes issues, they can disable it quickly and feed the learnings back into the next iteration. This rapid trial-and-error at massive scale has enabled Facebook to tune its user experience and features (such as News Feed algorithms or UI changes) based on continuous data rather than gut feel.
- **Netflix’s Rapid Iteration:** Netflix is another example – it practices a culture of “High Freedom and Responsibility” where engineers can deploy code anytime and are encouraged to experiment. Netflix deploys hundreds of incremental updates each day across its streaming service. Continuous discovery is evident in how Netflix constantly tests improvements to its recommendation engine and user interface. For instance, Netflix might experiment with different thumbnail images or promotional rows for content to see which leads to higher click-through or viewing time; these tests run on small subsets of users and the winning approach is rapidly rolled out. On the delivery side, Netflix’s investment in tooling (like the famous *Chaos Monkey* for testing resilience) allows them to continuously deploy without fear of bringing down the service – if an issue is detected, systems automatically fall back or engineers fix forward quickly. Together, this means Netflix is continually optimizing its service based on real user behavior and delivering updates without service disruption.
- **Enterprise Application (Microsoft’s Cloud Products):** Microsoft’s transition to cloud-based products also exemplifies CDD. In the era of Office 365 and Windows 10, Microsoft adopted a practice of ongoing feature updates driven by user feedback and telemetry. The **Windows Insider** program acts as a continuous discovery mechanism: a community of users test early builds of Windows features and provide feedback, which Microsoft uses to adjust features before wider release. For delivery, Microsoft moved to a more DevOps model – for example, the Office team now ships new or improved features on a monthly cycle (or faster for cloud services), gathering data on usage through telemetry dashboards. If a newly delivered feature in Word or Excel is not used or triggers complaints, the team investigates why (discovery) and may pivot in subsequent updates. This represents a major shift from the 2-3 year release cycles of the past to a continuous evolution of the product.

These examples demonstrate CDD’s benefits: companies can respond quickly to user needs and preferences, reduce wasted effort on unpopular features, and achieve high reliability despite fast-paced changes. They also show that implementing CDD can be done at huge scale (tens of thousands of deployments, experiments with millions of users) when supported by the right culture and infrastructure. Even organizations that are not tech giants can apply the same principles on a smaller scale – for instance, a SaaS startup might deploy new builds daily and use a cohort of early-access customers to continuously refine its product-market fit.

## Comparative Analysis of VSM and CDD

VSM and CDD are complementary concepts that share a common goal of improving value delivery, but they operate at different levels and address different aspects of the project value chain. Below is a comparative analysis highlighting their **similarities**, **differences**, and ways they can **complement each other**:

### Similarities and Synergies

Despite their different origins, VSM and CDD have several important similarities:

- **Value-Focus and Lean Principles:** Both VSM and CDD are fundamentally driven by maximizing customer value and minimizing waste. VSM achieves this by eliminating waste in process steps (ensuring each step adds value to the end customer) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Value,across%20multiple%20processes)), while CDD does so by avoiding building unneeded features and by quickly delivering features that have confirmed value. Each encourages a *lean mindset*: VSM explicitly comes from lean manufacturing, and CDD’s discovery practices stem from lean startup principles of validated learning, and its delivery from lean/agile engineering. In practice, both approaches force teams to continuously ask, “Is this adding value for the customer or not?” and trim the fat accordingly.
- **Continuous Improvement and Feedback Loops:** Both emphasize continuous loops of improvement rather than one-time changes. VSM is often carried out in a cycle (current state → future state → implement → measure → repeat), fostering a culture of ongoing process improvement (Kaizen). Similarly, CDD embeds iterative loops (build, get feedback, adjust) into daily work. The idea of **fast feedback** is central to both – VSM might use metrics like lead time or defect rates as feedback on process changes, whereas CDD uses user testing results and production metrics as feedback on product changes. In essence, *both create learning loops*: VSM learns about process effectiveness, CDD learns about product effectiveness.
- **Systems Thinking – End-to-End Perspective:** VSM requires looking at the *whole* system of work end-to-end, rather than optimizing individual silos. Likewise, CDD (when fully embraced) requires a team to think from the initial idea all the way to the user’s utilization of the feature. In continuous discovery one starts from user needs (initial concept) and in continuous delivery one ends at user impact (realization of value) ([Value stream - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream#:~:text=A%20value%20stream%20is%20the,usually%20aligned%20with%20company%20processes)) – together that covers end-to-end. Both approaches discourage local optimization that suboptimizes the whole. For example, a VSM view might prevent a team from only speeding up development while ignoring a testing bottleneck; a CDD view might prevent churning out code without confirming if it solves the right problem. They encourage *holistic optimization* of how value flows to customers.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Both VSM and CDD break down silos and require collaboration across different roles. VSM workshops bring together people from multiple departments to map and improve the value stream, which builds shared understanding and cooperation. CDD, as discussed, thrives in cross-functional product teams where product, design, and engineering work jointly on discovery and delivery. In both cases, the traditional boundaries between “business vs. tech” or “planning vs. execution” are blurred in favor of a *unified team focus on delivering value*. This similarity in team structure requirement means organizations often find that adopting one approach paves the way for the other – e.g., if you’ve reorganized into value streams for VSM, you likely already have cross-functional teams that can also adopt continuous discovery/delivery practices.
- **Support by Agile/Lean Frameworks:** Both concepts have been incorporated into modern agile and lean frameworks. For instance, SAFe includes value stream identification (for VSM) and also outlines continuous exploration and continuous deployment (for CDD). Lean Six Sigma projects combine VSM with iterative experiments to improve processes, somewhat analogous to combining process changes with verification (a DMAIC improvement cycle parallels a CDD cycle on the process itself). The synergy in frameworks means that practitioners are often exposed to both: learning one usually involves learning about the other in context.

In summary, VSM and CDD share a synergy in philosophical approach: **empirical, iterative improvement focused on customer value**. They both require cultural elements like openness to change, data-driven decision making, and empowering teams – making them kindred strategies under the broader umbrella of lean/agile thinking.

### Differences

Despite overlaps, VSM and CDD differ in scope, focus, and typical use cases:

- **Scope and Subject of Improvement:** VSM is primarily a **process improvement and management** technique. It looks at *how work is done* – mapping activities, information flows, and queues. The subject of analysis is the process itself (e.g., the development pipeline, the order fulfillment process). Continuous Discovery Delivery, on the other hand, is a **product development approach**. It looks at *what work is done* and *what is delivered* – exploring product requirements and executing implementation. VSM might be applied at a higher organizational level to improve an entire pipeline spanning multiple teams, whereas CDD is often executed at the team level for a specific product or feature set.
- **Origins and Background Discipline:** VSM originates from industrial engineering and operations management (lean manufacturing), adapted later to project/program management contexts. Its language often talks about waste, throughput, bottlenecks – terms common in manufacturing/process engineering. CDD’s lineage comes from software engineering, product management, and design. It speaks in terms of experiments, user research, CI/CD, etc. As a result, practitioners might come from different mindsets: a process analyst or project manager might drive VSM initiatives, whereas a product manager or scrum team might drive continuous discovery and delivery. This can lead to different perspectives – VSM is sometimes associated with management-level oversight (seeing the big picture process), while CDD is associated with on-the-ground team execution.
- **Primary Metrics of Success:** VSM’s success is often measured with **process metrics** like lead time, cycle time reduction, increased process efficiency (e.g., value-added ratio), reduced handoffs, etc. It’s about making the delivery mechanism faster and more efficient. CDD’s success is measured with **product/business metrics** and DevOps metrics: e.g., experiment win rate, customer satisfaction (or NPS), conversion rates, frequency of deployment, mean time to restore (for delivery), etc. In continuous discovery, a “successful” outcome might be invalidating a bad idea before too much time is spent, which is a learning metric. In continuous delivery, success might be deploying 10 times a day with no major incidents (a technical performance metric). These metrics are different in nature – one set proving the process is smooth, the other proving that the product is effective and the team is responsive.
- **Time Horizon and Cadence:** VSM exercises (especially in traditional orgs) might be done as periodic strategic initiatives – e.g., a quarterly or annual VSM review of how projects flow through the organization. While the ideal is continuous management, in practice some treat VSM as a project with a start and end (current state mapping done in a workshop, then improvements, then revisit later). CDD, by definition, is continuous in real-time; it’s a day-to-day way of working for a team, not a periodic analysis. Thus, VSM can at times be more *episodic* (though it shouldn’t be), whereas CDD is *ongoing*. Additionally, VSM can involve slow-changing aspects like organizational structure or tooling investments, which have longer cycle times to implement, whereas CDD deals with high-frequency cycles (sprint to sprint, release to release adjustments).
- **Deliverables/Outputs:** The output of a VSM initiative is often a **diagram and an action plan** for process improvement – for example, a future state map and a list of initiatives to implement (like “implement automated testing, reduce review wait times, change team alignment”). It’s a means to an end (better flow). In contrast, the outputs of CDD are the **product increments and validated learnings themselves** – new features delivered to users, experiment results that inform the next decisions, etc. CDD directly delivers customer-facing changes as part of its process, whereas VSM delivers internal changes. In short, VSM’s “deliverable” is a more efficient process (which indirectly leads to better customer value delivery), while CDD’s deliverable is the product with potentially higher customer value due to the process.
- **Tools and Artifacts:** VSM uses artifacts like value stream maps, Kanban/flow boards, and sometimes value stream management software to visualize work across teams. CDD uses artifacts like prototypes, user story maps, product backlogs, automated test suites, and CI/CD pipelines. There is some overlap (both might use Kanban boards, for instance), but generally the day-to-day tools differ (process modeling vs. product development tools). This also means the skill sets can differ: someone facilitating VSM might be skilled in process mapping and Lean analysis, whereas someone driving continuous discovery needs skills in user interviewing, UX design, or data analysis, and continuous delivery requires engineering skills in automation, testing, etc.

These differences highlight that VSM and CDD are not interchangeable – they address different questions. VSM asks **“How can we deliver faster and more efficiently?”**, while Continuous Discovery asks **“What should we deliver and why?”** and Continuous Delivery asks **“How can we get this into users’ hands frequently and reliably?”**. Both VSM and CDD are vital, but they operate at different layers of abstraction within project management.

### How VSM and CDD Complement Each Other

VSM and CDD can be seen as complementary strategies: one ensures you **optimize the pipeline**, and the other ensures you **optimize the product within the pipeline**. When used together, they reinforce each other and fill each other’s gaps:

- **Ensuring Speed *and* Direction:** VSM is excellent for improving speed and efficiency (doing things right), whereas continuous discovery ensures you’re doing the right things. Combining them means the organization can deliver quickly **without losing sight of delivering the *right* value**. For example, VSM might cut your feature lead time from 8 weeks to 2 weeks by removing process waste, but without continuous discovery you might spend those 2 weeks building a feature nobody needs. Conversely, continuous discovery might identify a brilliant new feature idea, but without an efficient value stream it could still take a year to deliver and miss the market window. Together, VSM + CDD means you identify high-value ideas and also implement them rapidly for users. It marries **effectiveness** (through discovery) with **efficiency** (through streamlined management).
- **Feeding the Value Stream with Valuable Work:** One way to view CDD is as the content that flows through the “pipes” which VSM optimizes. A value stream starts with a concept or request – continuous discovery provides a steady, validated flow of such concepts (e.g., a well-researched backlog of user stories or experiments) for the delivery process to execute. In organizations practicing both, teams often use discovery findings to prioritize their intake into the value stream. VSM then tracks that item’s journey to completion. If VSM analysis finds a holdup in, say, the approval stage of ideas, a continuous discovery approach could help by having pre-validated business cases that make approval faster, or by empowering product teams to greenlight experiments up to a certain scope. In essence, **continuous discovery can improve the front-end of the value stream**, ensuring that the queue of work entering the pipeline is high quality and based on real user value, which in turn makes the whole stream more value-focused.
- **Highlighting Different Kinds of Waste:** VSM tends to highlight wastes like delays, rework due to process issues, or excess handoffs. Continuous discovery might highlight a different kind of waste: building features that don’t solve a real need (a form of overproduction waste). By practicing both, an organization is addressing waste on two fronts – operational waste and product waste. For instance, if a team delivered a feature fast (process was efficient) but users didn’t use it (poor idea), continuous discovery practices would catch that earlier or at least learn from it after release, while VSM ensures that learning is quickly turned into a new direction without months of additional sunk cost. Both approaches ultimately strive for *leaner outcomes*, and together they ensure that any effort spent is more likely to result in value.
- **Adapting the Value Stream Based on Discovery:** Continuous discovery might reveal the need for new steps or capabilities in the process. For example, suppose through discovery a team finds that it’s critical to get user feedback on a beta version of a feature within days. The existing value stream might not support that (maybe deployments to a beta environment were not in the map). Using VSM thinking, the organization can modify the process (add a “beta release” stage, automate its deployment, create a feedback collection mechanism) as part of the value stream. In this way, discovery insights drive changes in the value stream configuration. Conversely, VSM might show that a particular stage (say, integration testing) is a bottleneck, which could prompt the team during discovery to constrain their solutions to ones that are simpler to integrate, or to find ways to test hypotheses with less overhead. This shows a interplay: discovery affects how the stream is managed, and stream constraints affect how discovery might proceed (what’s feasible to attempt quickly).
- **Scaling Continuous Practices:** VSM can help scale CDD across an organization. An organization might start with one team doing continuous discovery and delivery; scaling that to many teams requires ensuring each team’s efforts align and don’t conflict. By using VSM at a higher level, companies can identify value streams at the enterprise level and ensure each team’s continuous discovery/delivery efforts contribute to a larger coherent flow. For instance, if two product teams’ work feeds into one larger customer journey, a value stream map can show their integration points and help coordinate continuous delivery cadences or shared discovery (maybe both teams need to collaborate on a joint user test). Without the value stream view, teams could optimize locally (great CDD in their silo) but suboptimize globally (misaligned increments or duplicated effort). VSM thus provides a **framework for coordinating multiple CDD teams** by aligning them along the value stream.

In practice, organizations that successfully blend VSM and CDD create a powerful engine for innovation and delivery. One can imagine an iterative loop: value stream management reveals a process delay -> the team fixes it, allowing faster releases -> the team uses that speed to run more experiments -> the discovery from those experiments identifies a new high-value feature -> the streamlined value stream gets that feature out in a single sprint -> users get value sooner and provide feedback -> new insights go back into discovery, and so on. The end result is a learning organization that not only knows how to find the right answers but can implement them almost as quickly as they are found. This complementarity is increasingly seen as a hallmark of *high-maturity agile organizations* – they manage work as value streams (often moving from project-centric to product-centric funding and management) while simultaneously fostering continuous discovery and DevOps practices within those streams.

## Conclusion

Value Stream Management (VSM) and Continuous Discovery Delivery (CDD) are two advanced approaches that, together, address the twin challenges of modern project management: **building the right product and building it fast and efficiently**. VSM provides the macro-level lens to ensure that the entire process of value delivery is optimized – it brings visibility to how value flows (or gets stuck) and offers a method to relentlessly improve that flow ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Value,3)) ([Value-stream mapping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping#:~:text=Although%20value,10)). Continuous Discovery and Delivery operates at the micro-level within that flow, ensuring that teams are continuously learning about user needs and delivering enhancements in rapid, validated increments ([Continuous delivery - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#:~:text=Continuous%20delivery%20,is%20important%20for%20continuous%20delivery)) ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D)). Historically, VSM reminds us of the importance of lean thinking and eliminating waste in any endeavor (a lesson from manufacturing now embedded in agile project management), while CDD represents the evolution of agile to fully embrace ongoing product discovery and technical excellence in delivery.

Methodologically, organizations have a rich toolkit to draw from: lean mapping techniques, agile and DevOps practices, design thinking, and experimentation frameworks. The case studies and industry examples illustrate that these practices are not just theoretical – companies from Ericsson to Amazon have realized significant benefits by applying them (from faster time-to-market to higher innovation success rates) ([Forget 10,000-Hours; Edison, Bezos, & Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule | Observer](https://observer.com/2017/11/forget-10000-hours-edison-bezos-zuckerberg-follow-the-10000-experiment-rule/#:~:text=The%20technique%20is%20just%20as,%E2%80%9D)). Importantly, implementing VSM or CDD is as much about culture and organizational structure as it is about specific tools. It requires empowering teams, fostering collaboration, and making decisions based on data and customer feedback.

In comparative terms, we’ve seen that VSM and CDD are distinct in focus but highly complementary. Successful project management in an agile era often entails using **VSM to manage and improve the delivery system** and **CDD to continuously feed that system with the right inputs and outputs**. An organization that maps its value streams but neglects continuous discovery may become very efficient at delivering the wrong things; one that discovers continuously but has a poor delivery pipeline may learn what customers need but fail to capitalize quickly. The synergy of both yields a nimble, value-driven organization.

In conclusion, VSM and CDD together represent a holistic, end-to-end approach to project and product management. They embody a shift from managing projects by rigid plans to managing by adaptive value streams and feedback loops. For practitioners and leaders, mastering these concepts means being able to **visualize work as a flow of value**, to **measure and remove impediments** in that flow, and to **instill a cadence of continual learning and delivery**. Academic research and industry results increasingly validate that organizations which adopt these practices tend to outperform their peers in delivering value to customers rapidly and reliably. As the project management discipline continues to evolve, VSM and CDD stand out as critical components of its modern, agile toolkit – enabling projects to not only be on time and on budget, but above all, on target in meeting customer needs.

# Measurement, Tracking, and Managing Uncertainty

This chapter is titled “Measurement, Tracking, and Managing Uncertainty.” To accomplish those three tasks, a project manager needs to know how to recognize and resolve issues that could threaten the project’s successful outcome. A secondary goal of this chapter is to address the topic of problem detection and resolution.

**Problems** are generally understood and resolved using five distinct stages:

1. **Understand** the problem.
2. **Measure** the problem.
3. **Devise** a plan ****to manage the problem.
4. **Resolve** the problem
5. **Check** the resolution. 

Understanding the problem is an essential first step. If a project team or project manager is unclear about what needs to be solved, they will probably get the wrong results. Once the problem is clear to the project team, the team needs to identify the cause of the problem, collect relevant data, and measure the extent of the problem. Without detection and measurement, satisfactory resolution of a problem is not possible.

## The Measurement Performance Domain

The **Measurement Performance Domain** refers to the processes and activities related to quantifying and tracking project performance. It involves the use of various metrics and tools to measure project progress and outcomes, including cost, time, quality, and scope. This domain is crucial because it provides the data necessary to make informed decisions, manage risks, and ensure that the project is on track to meet its objectives.

The Measurement Performance Domain is important for **two** main reasons:

- It provides a reliable understanding of the status of a project and actionable data to facilitate decision making.
- Stakeholders can receive timely data, and appropriate actions can be taken to keep project performance on track to achieve goals and generate business value.

**MoSCoW Prioritization Scheme**

The MoSCoW prioritization scheme enables more granularity than the simple scheme because the product owner and customers are able to give further thought to the priorities.

The model has the following components:

- **Must have**: Essential features that are critical for the project's success. Without these, the project will fail.
- **Should have**: Important features that add significant value but are not critical. The project can still succeed without them.
- **Could have**: Desirable features that can enhance the project but are not necessary. They can be included if time and resources permit.
- **Won't have**: Features that are least important or not feasible within the current scope. These are often deferred to a future project phase.

The **Kano model** can help prioritize features based on the voice of the customer. This technique involves categorizing customer preferences into four groups, **based on what customers value**:

- **Dissatisfiers**: These features are essential and valuable to customers. The absence of such features will result in high disappointment with the product. We can categorize such features in the MoSCoW scheme as “must have.” An example of such a feature is the ability to quickly mute an incoming call on a smartphone if it cannot be answered.
- **Satisfiers**: These features are also called performance features. More satisfiers result in more satisfaction with the product. An example could be a dinner menu in a restaurant, with more menu items and variety most likely resulting in more satisfied customers.
- **Delighters**: These are surprising features that can be described as unexpected yet very delightful. An example might be fireworks at the end of a sports game when the home team wins. You can imagine the delight of the fans experiencing such an unannounced display.
- **Indifferent**: The customer’s reaction to these features is neither good nor bad. This category is like the MoSCoW prioritization category “won’t have.” Such features should be avoided altogether or ranked lower in the backlog. For example, organizing too many content-related events at a scholarly conference might conflict with the goals of conference attendees, who might want more time to either network with their colleagues or go out and see the city.

**Monopoly Money Scheme**

- The Monopoly money scheme uses the same concept as dot voting, but instead of assigning values or numbers of stars, each customer gets a finite amount of currency, such as US$2,000. Customers determine how much to invest in each feature, and the feature with the most money allocated at the end is prioritized highest.

**Stack Scheme**

- A simple but powerful prioritization technique is the stack scheme. In this approach, a team ranks the identified user stories by comparing them directly with each other. The most important story is on the top. A similar method is to use several evaluation criteria and use weights to prioritize each of the user stories based on the degree to which each of them exemplifies each criterion. In this approach, the criteria could be the value added by the feature, the urgency, the amount of implementation effort, or the implementation risk.

---

**Prioritization schemes** can be used in many situations for predictive and adaptive approaches. First, we illustrate the context and need for prioritization within adaptive projects by identifying the rationale behind prioritizing the contents of various adaptive project artifacts. 

**Product Backlog**

- The product owner develops the product backlog at the product level. Select, desirable features are identified that answer the question, “Why are we building the product?” At the start of the project, customers identify high-value user stories. Selected features are chosen to be a part of the first release.

**Release Backlog**

- Unless the product is small, there will likely be multiple releases. The team identifies features to be implemented for a particular release. The team discusses many different features; then the product owner, with help from the solution architect and other team members, prioritizes the features that are considered necessary to build a minimum viable product (MVP). After this prioritization, the initial product backlog is rank-ordered.

**Sprint Backlog**

- The sprint backlog is a subset of the release backlog and contains the user stories, tasks, and features that the team plans to work on during a specific sprint. During sprint planning, the team selects items from the product backlog based on priority and the team's capacity. The goal is to complete the highest priority items that deliver the most value to the customer within the sprint duration. Prioritization in this context ensures that the team focuses on the most critical tasks first, aiming to maximize the impact and value delivered in each sprint.

### Metrics

After a team understands its priorities, it must understand the metrics needed for measurement. 

- A **metric** describes a project or product attribute using some measure of it.
    - For example, one metric is **estimate to completion (ETC)**; this has come up in a few previous chapters. This particular metric is a measure of what additional cost to expect, measured from the point where the team is today until its work is finally completed.

Effective metrics are **SMART**

SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

- **Specific**: Clearly define what you want to accomplish.
- **Measurable**: Ensure that you can track your progress and measure the outcome.
- **Achievable**: Set realistic goals that are attainable.
- **Relevant**: Make sure the goals are important and aligned with broader objectives.
- **Time-bound**: Set a deadline to achieve the goals.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** are measurable values that demonstrate how effectively a company, department, team or individual is achieving key business objectives. They serve as a performance measure, allowing businesses to track progress towards their strategic goals. For example, in the context of a project, KPIs could include metrics like project completion percentage, cost variance, or stakeholder satisfaction.

- **Lagging indicators** measure project deliverables or milestones after the fact (that is, past performance). Examples include the number of deliverables completed, cost variance, and schedule variance. These KPIs measure activity or other factors that have occurred in the past. They are easy to count and measure but hard to influence because they have already happened.
- **Leading indicators** predict changes or trends in a project. They can be challenging to measure but help to gauge future project outcomes. Examples include delivery velocity or productivity for a team; these indicators can help predict the estimated cost or duration of a project. If a trend is unfavorable at a certain point, there may be an opportunity to evaluate the root cause and reverse the unfavorable trend.

**Progress Tracking**

- First and foremost, KPIs help teams effectively track a project’s ongoing progress. Thanks to progress tracking, any potential obstacles can be spotted at an early stage and addressed before they escalate. This ties in with the adaptable nature of agile, with teams pivoting quickly and making changes to improve a project deliverable.

**Decision Making**

- KPIs help leaders make decisions about a team’s workload or other project success factors. By using a KPI analytics tool, leaders can easily see if their team has the capacity to take on more user stories or if the team should reduce the number of stories for its next iteration. Agile is an approach that is frequently used in software development, and code-related KPIs, such as code churn and code coverage, are common. Testing is also a key element in this field; software developers often measure automated tests against manual tests, and measure test failures against tests performed.

Adaptive project KPIs can be communicated using these tools:

- **Burndown charts** are graphical representations that show the amount of work remaining versus time. They are commonly used in agile project management to track progress and determine if a team is on track to complete their work within the allocated time frame. The chart typically displays a downward slope, representing the gradual completion of tasks over a sprint or project timeline.
- **Velocity chart:** A graph showing **velocity**, which is a measurement of how much work has been completed by a team in a sprint. This measurement helps predict how much work a particular team could produce in subsequent sprints. Velocity can vary by team, depending on its experience and capability.
- **Cumulative flow diagram**: A visual tool that works with a kanban board to help teams better visualize cumulative flow, which is the team’s state of task distribution at various project stages.

This brings us to a formal term used to describe what done really means: **definition of done**. This is based on a checklist of all the criteria that must be met for a deliverable to be considered ready for customer use. In agile metrics, points accumulate only when an activity is fully done—that is, when all criteria are met and validated. A definition of done is created at each level of a project (for example, for each user story or release). 

**Burnup charts** are a graphical representation of work done versus total work remaining over time. They provide a visual way to track the amount of work completed and show how quickly a team is working through its backlog. This can help teams predict when work will be completed based on their current pace.

### Processes

**Velocity**, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, is a measure of a team’s capacity to complete project work. This metric measures how much work the team has completed in a particular iteration. It shows the productivity rate of the team and is based on the number of user stories completed in the past. Velocity is helpful in forecasting work that the team will be able to do in a future iteration, and it helps project a release date for a product. Velocity is a valuable metric that allows stakeholders to gauge when the project end or release end should occur.

- Note that velocity might vary in the first few iterations, but it is a reliable metric as iterations continue because the team becomes more accustomed to working together on a particular product backlog.
- Velocity can be measured using any unit but using story points (SPs) is a common approach in agile project approaches. SPs are estimates assigned to user stories based on effort, complexity, and risk.

**Throughput** is a measure of the amount of work or tasks that can be processed or completed within a specific timeframe. It provides insights into a team's efficiency or a system's capacity to deliver outputs.

**Cycle Time** is the total time from the beginning to the end of your process, as defined by you and your team. It's the total time it takes a team to complete a task or process once it has started.

**Lead Time** is the amount of time that elapses from the initiation of a process to its completion. In other words, lead time includes the time it takes to handle a request plus the time it takes to actually perform the task.

The *cycle time* is closely associated with **work in progress (WIP).**

**Work in Progress (WIP)** refers to the tasks or items that are currently being worked on but are not yet completed. In project management and various work processes, managing WIP is crucial because it helps in maintaining a steady workflow, avoiding bottlenecks, and ensuring that resources are effectively utilized. Limiting WIP can improve efficiency and ensure that the team focuses on completing tasks before starting new ones, thereby enhancing overall productivity and throughput.

**Cycle Time = WIP / Throughput**

![Untitled](Untitled%2022.png)

A **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)** is a visual tool used in project management to show the flow of tasks through various stages of a process. It helps teams understand the progress of work, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the workflow. The diagram typically consists of stacked area charts, where each area represents a different stage of the process (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

It is a valuable tool for tracking and forecasting value-added work in a project. It is also helpful for monitoring lead times and cycle times and for gaining insight into project issues in adaptive projects.

**Example of a Cumulative Flow Diagram:**

```
|           |                      Stage                     |
|  Time     |  To Do  |  In Progress  |  In Review  |  Done  |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| Day 1     |    10   |        0       |      0      |   0    |
| Day 2     |     8   |        2       |      0      |   0    |
| Day 3     |     7   |        3       |      1      |   0    |
| Day 4     |     6   |        4       |      1      |   0    |
| Day 5     |     5   |        3       |      2      |   1    |
| Day 6     |     4   |        3       |      2      |   2    |

```

In this example, the CFD shows the number of tasks at each stage of the process over six days. The heights of the areas indicate the number of tasks, and the width of the diagram represents the passage of time. This visual representation helps teams quickly see where tasks are accumulating and identify stages that may require attention or improvement.

### Information Radiators

**Information radiators** are visual artifacts displayed prominently in a team's workspace to convey key information to all team members. They are designed to be easily accessible and understood at a glance, promoting transparency and real-time updates. Examples include burndown charts, cumulative flow diagrams, and task boards.

A **dashboard** is a digital tool that aggregates and presents key performance indicators (KPIs) and other critical data in a visual format, often using charts, graphs, and gauges. Dashboards provide real-time insights into project performance, enabling project managers and stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly. They are commonly used to track metrics such as progress, budget, and resource utilization.

Visual controls exist for a wide range of reports, from completed tasks to tasks in progress and business value delivered. A **Kanban board** is a recognized example of a visual controls in most organizations because the Kanban board shows the progression of tasks across stages, adding to the team’s ability to predict, organize, and track their work in real time. 

- A **Kanban board** is a visual tool used in project management to represent and track the progress of tasks through different stages of a workflow. The board is typically divided into columns, each representing a specific stage such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Tasks are represented by cards that move across the columns as they advance through the workflow, providing a clear and real-time overview of the project's status and helping teams manage their work more efficiently.

## The Uncertainty Performance Domain

The **Uncertainty Performance Domain** refers to the processes and activities related to understanding, analyzing, and managing the uncertainties and risks associated with a project. This domain is crucial as it helps project managers anticipate potential challenges, devise strategies to mitigate risks, and prepare for unexpected changes that could impact the project's objectives. Effective management of uncertainty can significantly increase the likelihood of a project's success. Components of this performance domain are:

- **Ambiguity**: In project management, ambiguity refers to the lack of clarity or the presence of uncertainty in project requirements, instructions or objectives. It can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, and potential mistakes, affecting the overall success and efficiency of the project.
- **Complexity**: Complexity in project management refers to the number of interconnected parts or variables in a project. This includes various tasks, processes, team members, resources, or stakeholders involved. A project with high complexity may be more challenging to manage due to the increased potential for changes, risks and issues.
- **Volatility**: Volatility in project management refers to the degree of change and unpredictability in a project's scope or objectives. This can be caused by factors such as changing market conditions, technological advancements, or changes in stakeholder expectations. High volatility can make a project more challenging to manage and can require more flexibility and adaptability from the project team.

It is possible to identify conditions that will more likely lead to situations of uncertainty. Those conditions are related but are not limited to the following:

- **Project characteristics** (for example, complexity, system dynamics, time pressure, technological novelty, and uniqueness)
- The **project organization** and the involved **stakeholders**
- The project’s context in relation to its **political, economic, social, technological, legal,** and **environmental** (**PESTLE**) factors

In project management, an **opportunity** refers to a potential positive circumstance or event that, if seized, could bring beneficial outcomes to the project. Opportunities can present themselves in various forms such as potential collaborations, advancements in technology, or market trends. Effective project managers not only identify and assess these opportunities, but also devise strategies to capitalize on them to enhance the project's success and value.

### Strategies for Addressing Uncertainty in Projects

**Strategies for Navigating Ambiguity**:

- **Progressive Elaboration**: This strategy involves continuously refining and detailing the project plan as more information becomes available. It allows project teams to develop a more accurate understanding of project requirements and potential challenges over time, reducing ambiguity and improving decision-making.
- **Experiments**: Conducting experiments can help project teams test assumptions, validate hypotheses, and gather valuable data. Experiments enable teams to explore different approaches, identify potential issues early, and make informed adjustments to the project plan based on empirical evidence.
- **Prototypes**: Creating prototypes allows teams to build and test preliminary versions of the product or solution. Prototyping helps identify design flaws, gather user feedback, and refine requirements before full-scale development begins. This approach can significantly reduce uncertainty by providing tangible insights into how the final product will perform.

**Strategies for Mitigating Complexity**

- **Decoupling**: This strategy involves breaking down complex systems or processes into smaller, more manageable components. By decoupling, teams can isolate and address specific issues independently, reducing overall complexity and making it easier to manage and control different aspects of the project.
- **Simulation**: Using simulation techniques allows project teams to model and analyze various scenarios, predict potential outcomes, and assess the impact of different variables on the project. Simulations can help identify risks, evaluate strategies, and make more informed decisions by providing a virtual environment to test different approaches.
- **Diversity**: Embracing diversity in project teams can lead to a broader range of perspectives, ideas, and solutions. A diverse team can bring different skills, experiences, and viewpoints, enhancing creativity, innovation, and problem-solving capabilities. Diversity can also improve adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainties.
- **Balance**: In the context of creating a diverse data set for projects, balance refers to ensuring that the data collected encompasses a wide range of variables and perspectives. This means including data from different sources, covering various aspects of the project, and representing multiple viewpoints. A balanced data set helps in making more informed decisions, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the project's dynamics, reduces biases, and enhances the accuracy and reliability of the insights derived.
- **Iteration**: Iterative approaches, such as agile methodologies, involve breaking the project into smaller, manageable increments or iterations. Each iteration allows for continuous feedback, learning, and adaptation, enabling the team to respond to changes and uncertainties more effectively and improve the project's overall outcome.
- **Engagement**: Actively engaging stakeholders throughout the project helps ensure that their needs, expectations, and concerns are understood and addressed. Regular communication and collaboration with stakeholders can provide valuable insights, foster trust, and enhance the project's ability to navigate uncertainties and deliver value.
- **Failsafe**: Implementing failsafe mechanisms involves designing systems and processes with built-in safeguards to prevent or minimize the impact of potential failures. These mechanisms can include contingency plans, backup systems, and error detection protocols, ensuring that the project can continue to operate smoothly even in the face of unexpected challenges or disruptions.

**Strategies for Mitigating Volatility:**

- **Alternative analysis** is a technique used to evaluate different options or approaches to achieve a project's objectives. This process involves comparing the benefits, costs, risks, and feasibility of each alternative to determine the best course of action. Alternative analysis helps project teams make informed decisions by considering various possibilities and selecting the most advantageous option. It is particularly useful when dealing with uncertainty, complexity, and changing project requirements.
- **Reserves** in project management refer to the allocation of extra time, budget, or resources to account for uncertainties, risks, and unforeseen events. These reserves act as a buffer to ensure that the project can absorb shocks and continue progressing towards its objectives. There are two main types of reserves:
    - **Contingency Reserves**: These are allocated for identified risks and uncertainties that have been analyzed and quantified. Contingency reserves are included in the project budget and schedule to manage known risks that may occur during the project lifecycle. They are typically controlled by the project manager.
    - **Management Reserves**: These are additional funds or resources set aside to address unforeseen risks or unexpected changes that were not identified during the planning phase. Management reserves are not included in the project baseline but are controlled by higher management or the project sponsor. They provide an extra layer of protection against significant deviations from the project plan.

### Opportunities

**Opportunities** that are discovered during project implementation can be managed in the following ways:

- **Exploit**: Actions are taken to gain value from an occurring opportunity.
- **Escalate**: The project team and project sponsor agree that the identified opportunity is outside the scope of the project or outside the scope of the project manager’s authority. For example, a potential long-term service contract for machines that are delivered by a project may be beyond a project team’s authority, and other stakeholders might need to be involved to make a decision.
- **Share**: The opportunity is transferred to a third party that is better able to capture the benefits.
- **Enhance**: Actions are taken to increase the likelihood of opportunity occurrence.
- **Accept**: The occurrence of an opportunity is acknowledged, but no further actions are taken.

### Threats

In project management, **threats** refer to potential negative events or conditions that could adversely affect the project's objectives, timeline, budget, or quality. These threats can arise from a variety of sources such as resource constraints, technical challenges, stakeholder conflicts, or external factors like market changes or regulatory issues. Effective project managers identify, assess, and devise strategies to mitigate or manage these threats to minimize their impact on the project's success.

Threats that are identified during project implementation can be managed in several ways:

- **Avoid**: Actions are taken to eliminate a threat or to protect a project from the impact of a threat.
- **Escalate**: The project team and project sponsor agree that the identified threat is outside the scope of the project or outside the scope of the project manager’s authority. For example, an occurring threat of an economic downturn and its negative consequences for a project is outside of the scope of the project.
- **Transfer**: The threat is transferred to a third party (such as an insurance company) that will bear the impact if the threat occurs. Penalties that reduce payments to contractors under certain conditions of failure to execute properly are also examples of a transfer approach.
- **Mitigate**: Actions are taken to reduce the likelihood of a threat occurrence.
- **Accept**: The occurrence of an opportunity is acknowledged, but no further actions are taken.

### Tracking Progress to Manage Risk in Adaptive Approaches

When the iteration planning (or sprint planning) is complete, a development team works on a product. This effort occurs on a daily cycle, with each working day following a similar pattern. A similar cyclical pattern follows the end of each iteration or sprint: Delivery measurements are associated with all work completed and with WIP.

Progress tracking occurs each working day at the daily meeting (the daily scrum), which usually starts an hour after the workday begins. This 15-minute daily standup meeting allows the development team to present project progress data. Roadblocks or issues documented in the **impediments list** are updated at this meeting and escalated to the scrum master or project manager for resolution.

An **impediments list** is a documented record of obstacles, issues, or blockers that hinder the progress of a project or task. This list is used in agile project management to track and address impediments that the team encounters during their work. The items on the impediments list are typically reviewed and updated regularly, often during daily standup meetings, so that the team can identify necessary actions to remove these impediments and ensure smooth project progression.

No particular project approach causes more risk or uncertainty than another. However, an **adaptive approach** tends to be better suited to conditions in which uncertainty is higher and the team must thus act quickly to discover the areas of uncertainty in the project scope so that the project manager can account for it as early as possible.

**Risk Severity** is a measure used to quantify the potential impact of a risk on a project. It is calculated by multiplying the probability of the risk occurring by the impact it would have if it did occur. This helps prioritize risks based on their potential consequences, allowing project managers to focus on the most significant risks.

Section 2.8.5 of the PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition recommends calculating the severity of risk by using the following formula:

**Risk Severity = Probability of Occurrence x Impact of Risk**

Where:

- **Probability of Occurrence** is the likelihood that the risk will happen, often expressed as a percentage or a value between 0 and 1.
- **Impact of Risk** is the potential consequence or effect of the risk if it occurs, often quantified on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5 or 1 to 10).

By multiplying these two factors, you get a severity score that helps prioritize and manage risks based on their potential impact on the project.

# Value Stream Management (VSM) + Continuous Discovery Delivery (CDD)

## Value Stream Management (VSM)

Definition:

**Value Stream Management is the end-to-end visualization, optimization, and orchestration of all the activities (technical and non-technical) that deliver value to a customer** — across the whole organization, not just within a single project or product team.

Instead of thinking about work in terms of isolated projects ("build X, ship Y"), VSM frames everything as a flow of value — from idea, to development, to delivery, to feedback, to improvement.

**Key Principles:**

- Map the entire value flow (not just the software or product build)
- Identify and eliminate waste (Lean influence)
- Improve speed, quality, and alignment continuously
- Focus on customer outcomes, not just internal deliverables
- Metrics shift from "activity-based" (hours logged, tickets closed) to "value-based" (customer delight, business impact)

**Typical Components of VSM:**

- Value Stream Mapping (visualizing how value flows through the system)
- Flow Metrics (like lead time, flow efficiency, time-to-value)
- Connected Toolchains (integrating development, ops, customer feedback)
- Governance and Continuous Improvement Loops

**In PM Terms:**

Project managers become value stream facilitators, focusing not just on task completion, but flow optimization across the enterprise.

# **Continuous Discovery Delivery (CDD)**

Definition:

**Continuous Discovery Delivery is about blurring the traditional boundaries between discovery (figuring out what to build) and delivery (building and shipping it).**

Instead of long periods of market research, requirement gathering, and then handoff to delivery teams, discovery and delivery happen simultaneously — in tight, rapid, ongoing cycles.

**Key Principles:**

- Always be discovering: Continuously test assumptions, user needs, and market shifts.
- Always be delivering: Ship value incrementally, get feedback, and adjust course.
- Small bets: Validate small hypotheses before scaling up big investments.
- Cross-functional collaboration: Product, engineering, design, and PM collaborate tightly.
- Rapid experimentation: Low-cost experiments, quick MVPs (minimum viable products), and rapid iterations.

**Typical Tactics:**

- Customer interviews every single week
- Rapid A/B tests, usability tests, prototype demos
- Hypothesis-driven development (build small, test often)
- Metrics tied to learning as much as to shipping

**In PM Terms:**

The project manager becomes a discovery enabler, constantly helping the team frame experiments, gather insights, and pivot strategies based on live data — not just managing delivery timelines.

## **How They Relate**

- **VSM is the big system view:** ensuring the whole enterprise delivers value smoothly and sustainably.
- **CDD is the micro, team-level view:** ensuring that what the team is building is the right thing through constant discovery.

Together, they represent a move from output-focused management to outcome-focused and learning-focused leadership.

## **Forward-Thinking View: Why This Matters for PMs**

- **Project managers of the future will need systems thinking + product discovery skills.**
- The traditional PM role (scope-schedule-budget tracking) will shrink, while "Flow Facilitator" and "Outcome Catalyst" roles will grow.
- Career move: Specializing in Value Stream Management today could set you up for Enterprise Agile Coach, Director of Value Streams, or Head of Product Operations roles in 3-5 years.
- Organizations will need PMs who can not only execute, but also sense-make and strategize across complex, fast-moving systems.
